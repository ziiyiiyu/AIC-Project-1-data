In terms of levelling up LEC, if we have KC and G2 as Targamas says.

With Fnatic they just need to sort out their int and Humanoid/Razork need to show up and they'll be great.

With MKOI, whilst they showed signs of promise this split, Jojo had quite a poor performance and I'm not sure he is the solution to this levelling up idea.

With Vitality, I swear they should be better than what they've shown.

That G2 roster felt like it would always win LEC as long as they were playing at 40% of their max level which ended up translating into them having 0 serious competition.

"25","I have watched JKL on the international stage for years, and I've come to the conclusion that he is not serious about League at all. He is conducting some kind of social experiment. After being forcibly carried to a Worlds victory by TheShy in 2018, he must have started questioning the necessity of an ADC. Since then, his life's purpose seems to be testing the limits of how much an ADC can int while still allowing the team to secure victory. He is an ADC, but he's a ChillGuy who doesn't care at all about his trivial deaths. It's as if he believes that as long as the enemy team expends a lot of resources to kill him, his teammates should automatically win the team fight—assuming they are good enough. His insistence on playing Varus and Miss Fortune is also related to this philosophy","league-of-legends","0"

"57","NA aka Near Airport are the first region to complete the airport speedrun any%. After dominating the airport speedrun scene for several years, competition proved to be stifling despite tough competition coming through from the LEC team Mad Lions. This last year, NA announced a new approach that would bring fresh life and competition back into the scene.

&nbsp;

LTA aka Los Terminal Americano is the new airport hub designed to host not just the usual NA markets, but also expand into Latin American markets. The hub contains North and South terminals that also act as conference halls, to not only host the regional speedrun competitions but also act as the international hub for overseas tournaments, ensuring that the LTA teams have the best possible routes in both departing from and arriving back at the airport to maximise speedrun efficiency.

&nbsp;

In the inaugural LTA competition, Team Liquid smashed their way to the regional title, although Brazilian competition was fierce. Subsequently TL have once again dominated the First Stand tournament with a 3-7 individual game score. TL took inspiration from their coach who left for the airport ahead of the team to scout out the best routes, and this combined with their game score have ensured they are the first team to arrive back at the airport.

&nbsp;

LTA commissioner Mark Zimmerman was interviewed, ""We are extremely happy with how LTA has set us up well for future expansion and that we've seen such prominent results already. The new LTA hub hosts a suite of modern airport features including Korean (and other regions) immigration fasttrack, a wide security hall to maximise throughput, and of course Tesla-powered elevators and walkways to get people through the airport as fast as possible."" He continued, ""This investment will surely inject more passion and entertainment into our region and ensures that we are in good steading to continue to dominate the airport speedrun any% for the next few decades.""","league-of-legends","0"

Big heads up, helped all the setup and leaves at the very last second he possibly could.

Also good on TL for clarifying this and updating the fans on his status.

  
After Peter Dunn quieted down a bit, Spawn has become one of my favourite personalities. Incredible story, great conversation and being an awesome coach helps","league-of-legends","0"
"95","Its wild how he came back and they turned from headless chickens and won the split. And then he left and suddenly they’re headless chickens again. Can’t say I’ve seen a bigger coach impact.

Definitely respect him for putting family first.","league-of-legends","0"
"96","How incompetent is the rest of the staff that they finally got Ziggs through bans and then didn’t let APA play it? That has to be one of the most brain dead coaching choices I have ever seen. This isn’t a hindsight thing either; watching it live was pretty frustrating.","league-of-legends","0"
"97","If this was a known thing I dont understand why it was not a transparent thing to TL fans before going into the tournament. Saves the reactions and rumour's flying round. 

Also support staff and team clearly are not capable as seen during the season and the one game he was missing from. Spawn listing it as an achievement is wild. They were saved by his direct influence in person. 

This wouldn't happen in NBA and it shouldn't happen in LoL. Coaches have a direct influence negative or positive. This is clearly negative.","league-of-legends","0"

"100","If Impact and Umti aren’t gone this org isn’t serious. How many times does Impact need to look like this before he gets moved to coach? He used to step up in internationals and play to the level of his opponents, but he’s looked bad for like the last 2-3 years. He is one of the oldest players in the world. It’s fucking time man. He is a straight up liability. His only strength the last 2 years has been his knowledge of lane swap. Which is all completely worthless now. No way they make MSI/Worlds with this roster.","league-of-legends","0"

"109","I mean it is a one team per region event that is ran after a very short split/preseason.  I think being ‘underwhelming’ is to be expected.  My guess is they will look at the viewership and see if they will expand it new year.  Remember this is a 1 week event and teams are already complaining about the rushed schedule.  KC just had their LEC finals one week prior and LPL is starting new week.

I think Riot did listen to fans and try to fit in a 3rd international but scheduling was always going to make things pretty tight.  At the end of the day, I think many fans want to see more top teams playing each other (internationals, more Bo3/5, more double Elim) but that has to be balanced with region play and teams that don’t make the playoffs.  Or else you just get a ecosystem where each region only have 5-6 teams.","league-of-legends","0"

I also discovered Mac devices didn't even support g-sync/adaptive sync back then (not sure in the present day).

It’s where most of the top side criticism came from since they were doing badly enough to the point where they had to take Spawn away from his family for a brief moment in order to win. Right now, TL not only needs the topside of the team to get their shit together but the drafting needs to get better as well.

I hope Spawn is able to figure out what he needs to do long term to make it work to be able to be with the team both regionally and internationally. If that path doesn’t look viable for him I hope he’s able to pursue other opportunities that fit his personal needs.

"150","People in this thread talking about Yuumi or Garen (fuck Garen, all my homies hate Garen, genuinely disgusting champ to play against) being worse than Yi either always played with CC-heavy comps against Yi or they never played against a semi-competent (aka breathing and not blind) Yi player back in the day (holy shit I am old).

Legit there was nothing quite as terrifying as Yi reaching 25 minutes into the game, being 0/1/2 and then pressing R and sprinting at your adc when you only had one or two targeted CC's that could hit him reliably.

Skillshot CC? Unreliable and he has the advantage to dodge because of his ult and Q.

Targeted? Still has Q

You waited for after the Q to target him? Tough fucking luck, your squishy is dead and now he has Q again

You zone him and try to burst him? W damage reduction and a ton of lifesteal 

Was he unbeatable? No, of course not. But he was very much the crown prince of ""You didn't counter me in champ select by magically foreseeing that I, the last pick, wanted Yi and now no fight is gonna be on your terms ever past 25 minutes"" which made him super frustrating in low elo especially because Yi has enough tools to dodge/bait CC rather than just face tank it like, say, Garen","league-of-legends","0"

Your damage literally doesn't matter outside of laning phase and you use support and tank items well so build whatever that game calls for to keep yourself and your teammates alive.

His team is IMO the most cracked one in the LCK right now, and whilst GENG and T1 both have good players, there are concerns about how Doran typically performs at internationals and how Duro will perform as a rookie. By contrast, HLE is filled with 5 insanely talented and generally consistent players at international events. 

I haven’t seen much LPL though but if TES is their best team (it’s prob not), I think it should be pretty favored to HLE. 

I also think the removal of lane swaps and full fearless draft will be insanely beneficial to HLE, For example, Zeus has shown to have an absolute cracked champion ocean and is one of the best solo laners in the world.

Gen G I'm less sure about, I think they're definitely worse in the regular season without Peyz and with Duro but I won't count them out either with Ruler being Ruler. Chovy is also trying to change his playstyle.

All in all, I'm not placing my bets on HLE they're undoubtedly the best right now but we're only in march and one weak link will tumble them into a slump. They look so much better with Zeus though.

Chacha: Means housemaid. In Mexico its sometimes used like an american ""Kid"" or ""D0g"". Like ""I pay you, Im more than you, you are my housemaid"".

Chíngate: Literally ""fck 0ff"".

Chúpame: Sck me off

Cstm: Chingue su put4 m4dre but with bad spelling. English would be something like ""Fck your wh0r* mother"".

Ctmp: same as above

Macaco: Literally means Ape. Refers to the Animal.

Machista: Women hater. Dunno why this would be bad, in LAN eGirl flaming is a reaaal issue. Maybe has to do with that. If you play enchanter you are assumed 1. Bad 2.Female. 3. Carried or duo boosted.

Machorra: Manly female. Usually directed towards lesbians as a pejorative term.

Manco: One armed, handless. This one is very common at it has been so often used in LOL latinamerican community it has becomed even understood outside the player based as ""you are bad at that"" or ""get gud"". If you call Manco someone outside the game its pretty likely they will understand the meme.

Teletón: This one is also interesting. Teletón is a Mexican non profit foundation directed to help people with functional disabilities, cancer or autism. Therefore, it is used as that ""you are a member of teleton"" or a common one is ""dude is probably playing from teleton's headquarters"".

NA showed up against EU, shit the bed the rest of the tournament and due to some pretty ridiculous time saving anti tiebreaker decisions , will limp through as the obviously weakest side.

"174","plants decide fights unless you are one shotting the opponent or they are one shotting you. Hexgates can also be quite impactful for the team that wants to run away/avoid getting engaged on.

 Think about when you can save rerolls and when you need to use them (is there something you could get that is much better than your current options?).

Think about when to buy anvils or full items, you can also buy stat anvils, you can sell starter item or even boots to buy a full item one round earlier, all these things make a difference.

Also before every round look at the enemy team, their augments, items and what map you are playing on and try to find what is your win condition(s). For example if you're playing zyra lux or something like that, against mundo tahm, your goal should be to run, avoid being in the same screen as the enemy and only contest plants if anything.","league-of-legends","0"
"175","Having a deep understanding of all the items and how they interact with your champion as well as augments is a lot of the battle. You can give yourself a huge boost just by knowing more than others.

Also don't force your champions meta summoners rift build. Look at your damage scalings and abilities and pick whatever makes the most sense. Play around the augments and items you get, not what your champion ""typically builds""

"176","I play Bravery and exclusively Stat Anvils in like 90% of my games nowadays for Arena, and I almost always end at least top 4 unless I just get hyper crushed early game. My point here being I don't really think the augments and ""builds"" matter that much, just play to have fun!

As far as actual advice, the Power Flowers are incredibly important, as is knowing when to run away through a Hexgate. Which map you're on, who you're fighting, it all sorta adds up and the only way to get better is to keep at it!

It also helps to remember your champ and play accordingly. ADCs are gonna poke and run, Bruisers are gonna facetank, etc, you gotta expect what your opponent is gonna do and just... don't do what they expect! Sometimes I like to run straight at them as an ADC, flash through them, and hit the hexgate they started near.

"192","I have always thought it would be neat to have a champion that can switch between a magic-damage form and a physical-damage form. Where any AD or AP you buy is just converted into Adaptive Force instead, and converts as needed for each form. The basic identity of this champion would be that it has access to a gigantic variety of items and therefore a ton of versatility.

Like someone like Kayle or Riven (thematic-wise). Who can switch between a melee sword form, or a magic sword form. In the melee form, they fight like a skirmisher with physical damage. In the magical form, they can launch magic waves with their sword and similar thematic spells that deal magic damage.

It would be hard to balance, because it would be difficult for enemies to itemize defensively against.  
But i don't necessarily think it would be impossible. You would just need to make sure they don't have any % damage built into their kit, so that HP is a decent stat that enemies can use to help build defensively if needed against them, and make sure that none of their ratios are absurd so that they can't just nuke people.

Or maybe this champion might not be allowed to switch forms freely. But instead has to choose one permanently similar to Kayn. But they still get all of their AP and AD converted to adaptive force so they have access to basically every item in the game. Because they have access to every item in the game, and two seperate playstyles, it would be a champion that could have potentially dozens of different viable builds and playstyles instead of always just being the same core build/champion every game.","league-of-legends","0"
"193","There's some interesting stuff from Heroes of the Storm 


Ragnaros's ultimate can replace a dead tower with himself for a period and gets upgraded abilities from his fixed position.


Cho'Gall is a two headed/two player champion. Think Yumi except can't ever split up, people might consider this less annoying than Yummi as it's a massive drawback always having two champions on the exact same position.


Rexxar & Misha are two characters controlled by one player. Misha is a bear pet that some of rexxars abilities controls. I'm not all that good with my hands and even I didn't mind playing it, it also helped that they were very tanky and Rexxar was technically a medium range character. Killing Misha gives like 1/3 of a kills worth of rewards and Rexxar can Rez her in lane.


The Lost Vikings are 3 characters in one, each capable of soaking experience and moderate fighting but it's like trying to play StarCraft on steroids if you are jumped in there different places at the same time.

"194","I would love a version of hextech gunblade from TFT. It basically heals both the user and the lowest nearby ally as omnivamp from the owner's damage. It's kinda like the knight vow effect but this is an item the damage dealer is buying to make his front line get more durable and both of them heal not just 1.

Ability to reduce enemy ability haste and casting speed/projectiles. It's more like a magic resist frozen heart/nasus W. And yes AS increases the basic attack animation speed this is why i went for casting speed too.

AP thornmail that hurts ability users for attacking them. This can be an item or ability like rammus W.

Magnetic field that sucks all skillshots to certain point. It can be like wind wall but the targeted projectiles must find a target after that, so they will go back to the caster or continue to reach the original target depending on the distance or other rules.

A bard (not like the one we have but an actual one that plays a flute or other instruments) who can combo like hwei. He gets 10 abilities too using the QQ, QW, QE, etc mechanic. He gives wide variety of effects like % damage  amp, AD boost, AP boost, AS boost, AH boost, MS boost, heal and mana restore, shield, slowing zone (like a 600 units randuin omen slow active), a split second AOE fear like vex W+P. This is not all ofc as you can play 2 notes at the same time like AP+ damage amp note together or heal+shield notes together. Range is like seraphine W to act as the heart of the team like bards usually do in D&D games. And R is not a simple ultimate ofc. It will be a queue for notes to play one after another (3/5/7 based R on level) as you can prepare it like unsealed spell book or by other means like holding R instead of tapping it to arrange the order. These notes are stronger and can use the same note over and over and over for the entire duration of the ultimate.

I hope i didn't cook some 200 years champion. And if it looks broken you can add a self disarm while playing the notes and he can only basic attack when the notes are not playing (i stole that from yuumi).","league-of-legends","0"

Garen going stridebreaker, swifties/berserkers, PD, LDR should not be allowed to pop enemies while being decently tanky and very slippery. He has to let go off something to have the rest.

Darius getting all the AD in the world after hitting 5 times can allow him to stack any MS/durability he wants. He goes yuumus first item to be the fastest MF in the game at this point and possibly kill the enemy while stacking his passive. After that he stacks all the MS+durability items as he deals more than enough damage now.

If a mage, assassin or ADC does the same, it will be called out for being unhealthy to the game. But when it comes to fighters it's normal to get everything because they are melee and you can easily run from a 500 MS darius running at you somehow.","league-of-legends","0"

"216","Depends on what ur goals are for the game. Are u just playing for fun? If so, it doesn't matter and u should just play what u enjoy. If role swapping is gonna acheive that, then go for it

If however, ur playing to climb and improve srsly, then it's often recommended to stick to one role and 1-3 champs. This is bc constantly switching roles and champs just means that u aren't learning the full dynamic of ur champion and the lane. Not only that, but u'll have scattered knowledge from all the different roles and champs being played, which can easily lead to information overload, resulting in little to nothing being learnt overall. To give an example, everytime u pick up a new role or add a new champion to ur pool, u have to divert a large portion of ur focus into figuring out how to pilot ur champion and role dynamics. This takes away from ur mental capacity to focus on laning essentials such as last hitting, trading, cd tracking, jg tracking, map awareness etc. Compare this to if u are already familiar on a champion. Piloting the champ becomes second nature to u, and u don't need to divert as much attention into thinking about how to play ur champion (eg. getting comfortable with their ranges, mana management, cds etc), and can instead focus more on ur in-game decision-making skills

That being said, if ur able to get the best of both worlds (find a role/champ u enjoy and spam it), it would be most ideal. After all, playing what u enjoy will make the learning experience more fun and rewarding than if u were to play smth that u don't enjoy. Forcing urself to play smth u don't enjoy will feel like a chore, resulting in burnout and/or make u lose motivation to play. Compare this to playing a champ that u enjoy: even if u lose at least u will still feel motivated to keep learning and improving due to champ enjoyment

"221","Why not just change the bounty system from a team-wide system to an individual system?  
If you are way behind in exp and gold (got stomped in lane) you would get a small amount of extra gold (and maybe exp) if you get a kill or a tower. Just you, regardless of who you kill.  
Doesn't matter which team is winning or losing. Just make it based on an individual basis to help players who are really far behind catch back up even just a bit and it basically takes care of itself.  
The entire reason the bounty system is so hard to fix is because there are so many opportunities for the bounty to go to the wrong place or show up on the wrong specific person who doesn't deserve to have a bounty on their head.  
If you make it more like objective bounties; except for individuals instead of teams, then this issue cannot happen.

It doesn't need to be such a strong bounty system that that the losing player can just instantly swing back into the game after 1 or 2 kills. But at least enough to give them a chance to become useful again if they play smart.

It's never made sense to me the way the current bounty system works. Because you can get a bounty on your head for just CSing well, which is absolutely ridiculous.  
The reason the bounty system exists is to help an enemy who you put behind have a chance to catch up.  
When you kill someone, you don't just gain 300g. You also put that enemy like 150-200g behind as well as half a level. The bounty is there to help close this gap when it starts to get too big.  
If you just sit in lane and CS well, you are not putting ANY enemy behind, and therefore, getting a bounty on your head just because you played Kayle or something the way she is meant to be played is literally insane.

The fact that a fed enemy ADC can come kill me midgame when i am playing Kayle or Teemo and collect a bounty even though i am not really fed and they definitely are ahead is mind boggling.

If you set the bounty system up to be individual based instead of team-gold based, you get rid of the chance of a fed person collecting a bounty when they don't need it, which is the opposite of what the bounty system was designed to do.

  
Alternatively: If you have a bounty on your head, you should not be able to collect bounties on other players, unless theirs is higher than yours. And you would get the difference in gold between the two bounties, instead of the full bounty.  
This way fed players cannot just go around collecting more bounties when they definitely are not the person the system was supposed to be helping.","league-of-legends","0"

"238","To me, the most fun aspect of drafting by far is adaptation.

Oh we got stomped by the standard first pick in the first game? Can we ban out 2 characters that usually have high synergy with them and then let them through? Or are we forced to ban them? What if we leave a permaban open so our opponent's have to chose between giving us the permaban or what they just stomped us with?

This is also true on a macrolevel: It is a lot of fun to me to follow the meta over the entire tournament. Last worlds Yone/Aurora were THE two picks. But then Skarner started to become more and more of a concern as well, is giving Yone if it means getting Skarner (and having a target ban more) worth it? Jax and Ashe are two other picks that changed over the tournament and it was a lot of fun to follow.

Another part that is disappointing to me is that draft is just harder to follow. Sure, the interactions between characters is not different, but there are more moving pieces to keep track of and it just isn't as possible to follow a draft and understand what is being setup for with every ban unless you are absolutely cracked.

Is the larger variety in game worth that? Maybe, depends on what you like, but the actual drafting phase is just providing less for an invested fan.","league-of-legends","0"

"242","It's not always as easy to rotate to dragon as it might seem. Especially the very first dragon, because of how low death timers are.  
  
Its very easy to end up in a situation where yes: you just ganked and killed the enemy and/or just crashed a wave, but they also just respawned and spent their 1200g, while your ADC/support did not get to recall and spend their gold. Your ADC/Support might also now be half HP. It only takes like 20-30 seconds (including the grey screen) after dying early to get back to lane.  
  
So while it might seem like the dragon is free, it might really be a bad idea if you take even a few seconds too long to jump onto it. The window is extremely tiny early game. During this window, if your ADC chooses to stay and help with dragon, they lose their chance to recall because the enemy will be back in lane and pushing. So, yea, you might get the dragon, but your ADC is now in a really bad position. They either need to stay in lane with half HP and sitting on 1200+g against an enemy who just spent their gold, or they need to base and just lose a whole wave of minions and possibly a turret plate too because they are so behind on tempo now.

If you are tracking the enemy jungler: You know which side of the map they are likely on once dragon and grubs are up. This will tell you which objective they are likely to go for, and also which other objective you can go for. Instead of asking your team to help kill dragon, understand that dragon or grubs can instead be taken for basically free solo as long as you aren't on the same side as the enemy jungler is and your laner's are not dead.  
Buy a control ward on your first base as a jungler and use it to secure vision inside the pit of the objective you want to solo, especially if that objective is dragon. (You usually don't need a control ward for killing first void grubs, its very very unlikely to be warded.)

That being said, i agree that at least the support should rotate towards dragon after a successful gank if they have the HP for it. Its not the end of the world for the support to be a little behind on Tempo and help secure first dragon.","league-of-legends","0"

"281","A few plausible theories:

1) They’re smarter than they seem. They’re testing consumer reaction. “Test balloons” as u/Rock-swarm put it. Seemingly haphazardly announcing bad decisions but actually carefully planned large scale AB testing. 
2) They’re smarter than they seem. They have a detailed sense of what generates value and what doesn’t and ultimately they don’t really care. They’re willing to slowly nuke Esports or Clash or anything else because players who care about A generate X% less revenue than players who care about B and we’ve got enough Bs and they’re easier to satisfy. We don’t know what percent of the top spending players make up what percent of their total revenue but it could be that most Reddit complaints just don’t matter. 

1 and 2 can also be part of shifting the goal posts. Memory is short and attention is shorter and they might just be willing to sacrifice blips of bad sentiment to move away from doing things that are less profitable. 

3) They’re grossly incompetent. 

It’s probably somewhere in the middle. But I think I kind of hope it’s a mix and if it has to be one, I hope it’s the third. 

I do love your emphasis on QA and the class project analogy is very interesting. My running joke is to suggest an intern did it (sorry interns! I was one once too, so I get it). When the stats that would come on screen during LCS last season were just nonsense, it preserves the most hope to assume a poor intern did it with very little time or resources. 

The First Stand HUD is an interesting case to consider. Is it

1 or 2) More mobile friendly? Requires more active prolonged attention? Etc? 
3) The HUD UI team suck at their jobs/are under resourced.

It’s hard to understand why Riot just gets things wrong. Be better. You have tons of money to play with. Why do different regions have different formats and HUDs and all this.

"294","What you’re doing OP is good! 
People saying “dont pick for comps” aren’t really saying what they mean i think.

Ideally (in general, not always) You’ll want to have a small roster of champs in your position, that fill a variety of roles for a comp.

For random example, having Galio, Syndra, Akshan , covers you if you need to round out a comp with Galio, or provide good burst with some cc on syndra, or provide some more range and ad if maybe your jg is melee AP or something.

Rough idea, but the point being that you’d want to aim for a small champ pool of champions you actually do enjoy, that you play often and well, and can pick interchangeably depending on whats more fitting.

The issue OTP’s run into, is that you’d end up playing your champ in unfavourable matchups, and just rely on being so much better at your champ that you outplay the opponent and win.

When in a much better world, you have that, but, also another couple champs to round out when you are counterpicked or have a bad matchup for your one trick.

TL:DR.
Keep up what you’re doing, limit the champ pool to a few different playstyle and role filling champs, and keep thinking about comps, it is vital knowledge to have, even if its not permanently applicable every single game. Sometimes the better move is to just pick your comfort picks and play to your strengths, sometimes its best to pick the perfect champ that you still play somewhat often.

Since 2020, every piece of the ship has changed except for JackeyLove, yet their fate remains the same: TES continues its cycle of smashing the LPL only to fumble.

But what happens when JackeyLove leaves? Will TES still be TES? Their unshakable ability to throw games suggests that yes, the spirit of the ship will persist.

"317","I love using it with echoes of helia as sona. The combo is insane in arena as you damage the enemy with a basic attack and proc a heal from one item to trigger the heal+damage from the other.

If enemy team are doing the funny 2 tanks they die from repeated procs of EOH and all their damage is basically healed.

I don't think the 2 items can exist together in summoners rift but i would love to try it there.","league-of-legends","0"
"318","You would probably have to remove the AP and AD ratios on the heal to make sure non-enchanters can't abuse it, but I think the item would be cool as a more offensive enchanter item. It would have nice synergy with Ardent Censer, since the enchanter also gets the buff, but it was rarely worth it to auto attack just because of a small AS and on hit buff. The item definitely shines in smaller skirmishes, since you probably won't get to auto attack much in a 5v5, so it even has a nice niche that no other enchanter item currently fills.","league-of-legends","0"
"319","Speaking of which, I had an idea for a support Sheen item that was like Lich Bane in that it did magic damage and would scale with AP, while additionally scaling with heal and shield power. Of course it would deal far less damage. However it would enable the Spellblade attack to be used on an ally, healing them for what would be the damage from the auto-attack; it would basically convert the auto-attack into healing and then heal the ally for that amount.","league-of-legends","0"

"321","It is likely because most players know where their trinket is keyed to. 8 isn't convenient to hit compared to 4 the default for most players unless they have a MMO or MOBA mouse. I use a MMO mouse and I still manage my activated items location based on where my thumb rests. 4 is the most comfortable one though so it is my trinket. 

I agree that herald on trinket is absolutely atrocious and it feels like punishment for taking an objective way too often. I wish herald had its own button to click on on screen to drop it and its own hotkey. Why should a team lose wards/sweeper/blue because they won an objective. If Riot wants herald to be non strategically used it should just summon 3 mini heralds one in each lan when it is taken or something else. I am so tired of not being able to ward or sweep because my team and I took Herald.","league-of-legends","0"
"322","Partially probably cuz code limitations, since taking up an item slot would be annoying for some builds, but I always also thought that Rift taking up your vision slot was on purpose to force a tradeoff to use it. Decreasing snowballing, basically. Rift is already extremely strong, so adding a bit of downside/pressure would force you to use it smartly (e.g. for pressure before objectives, or coordinating a group to rush a push) instead of simply holding it for after you win a teamfight (since usually the stronger team gets Rift) which might be the right decision more often than Riot would like.","league-of-legends","0"
"323","Riot have full on talked about this year's ago, herald takes up a trinket slot because it gives you so much power so it's a trade off. That's it, it's a purposeful choice by them to balance out it's strength as an objective. ","league-of-legends","0"

I agree that queueing up on a loss streak is a bad idea and that it lowers quality of games but I don't think it logically follows that Riot should prevent these players from queueing up again.

My advice would be to not look up your teammates accounts if seeing things like a teammate on a loss streak is so frustrating to you that you feel the need to come up with a solution and post it on reddit","league-of-legends","0"
"331","I'm only saying this because you specifically stated ""3 rankeds,"" but if Riot were to implement this, literally no one could play - and no, that's not an exaggeration.  

Have you ever watched pro players stream? EVERY pro player has streaks of losses, which means every person on Earth who plays the game has streaks of losses. Just watch Broxah - dude has loss streaks all the time.  

If you wanna say 20 games of straight losses, then *maaaaybe* we could talk, but even then, there's so many factors that would have to be analyzed and confirmed before issuing a proper temp ban.  

Tbf, I understand your sentiment of wanting people to play the game as long as they're in a good mental and emotional state. But that's simply not human. Some people are broken, some are addicted, some are hurting, some are tilted, and some are just having bad luck or an unfortunate streak. It happens all the time, every day.  

I say this to anyone who plays the game, wants to get better, and will listen: league is a 10% test of your skill and a 90% test of your mental. That includes int'ing, trolling, and griefing teammates. We can't control what others do, but we can control our own gameplay and adapt. It's proven the better you keep your mental, the better you play and thus, the more you win.  

So yea, you can be mad at your teammates for carrying their loss streaks into your games, but it won't change anything, because that will always happen. Always. Take a look at your own loss streaks. You're telling me that if you ever get 3 losses in a row you shouldn't play?

How do you rank up, or better question when do you rank up? You rank up when you acquire the knowledge, and use it against your enemies.

Just mixing up the game kept it feeling fresh.  
We have had basically the same runes for like 5 years now and its just kind of bland.  
Other than maybe Lethal Tempo getting multiple spicy changes throughout the years, the majority of the runes have been pretty standard and homogenous.

I feel like the game used to get a lot more broad changes just to keep the game interesting. But they have become more and more afraid of large changes because they don't want to upset the esport balance, i think.

Even things like the Mythical item system. Even though overall it was sort of a flop, i still want to see more things like that. I want to see them be creative and have big idea and try big things.

How about new summoner spells?

There used to be a lot more niche items to choose from, i feel like. And now the majority of items are kind of ""pidgeon-holed"" for specific champion archtypes instead of being freeform. Instead of choosing to build a damage item and then a defensive item, which gave you a lot of specific choices on exactly how you wanted to get your damage and exactly how you need your defense, and instead you now just get a whole stack of bruiser items that have basically every stat you need in one. No real choice anymore.   
You used to need to choose if you wanted to build high AP, high cooldown, or high mana, but now you kind of just get items that provide all three, no real choice to be made.

You used to get to choose 3 crit items and then two situational items on an ADC which really made a big difference in build diversity, choices and adaptability for crit users. Now you basically just have a huge slew of 25% crit items, most of which are bad, and you don't have room for any real situational items in most games.","league-of-legends","0"
"381","Runes: Definetely need to be reassessed. Theres too many that are simply unclickable when compared to other runes in their slot. Summoner Spellbook is a good example of Keystones that almost nobody ever uses. Which is a shame because its a super cool rune, but that doesnt make it good. I legit cant remember the last time I saw spellbook in a match.

Items and champions feel alright to me. New champs have always been a little op and I think its good they update older champs to be more relevant. Items feel the best they have in awhile imo. ADC itemization could be a bit better, but its not bad either.

The problem is the amount of teams. 5 teams from 5 regions will never feel like a tournament, and with the level gaps between regions the level of play / excitement is just missing

Double the teams and the entire feel of the tournament changes. It did wonders for the quality of MSI and I just can't comprehend why we are trying to run it back with First Stand

If this tournament had CFO+Talon, HLE+GenG, KC+G2, TL+C9, TES+AL ... Man that would be so hype

"393","Sounds fun, doesn't work. Look at Skarner, his pick rate and his win rate. He was intentionally gutted for First Stand and then he's still picked on stage and wins games. So it looks like nothing has changed, because the super OP champs that need to be banned every game have to be banned every game, or you sacrifice game 1 and let one team have it to free up a ban for later - which doesn't work because next time you get side selection and can choose to first pick if you banned the champion game 1.","league-of-legends","0"
"394","True, but you are forgetting the bans. If a champ is so OP, he might get banned in all games and still creates the same problem. Less likely to happen, but we had Skarner just now as an example.

You won't see Riot nerfing champs because of a 80+% presence in pro play, but because of a 60+% presence now.

Yone has a 68% presence in last stand and is likely on Riots watch list for pro play nerfs but in soloQ his WR is around 47.5-48% only. He will for sure see no buffs in this state due to pro play.

Another example is KSante. Even with recent nerfs he still shows up strong enough for pro play to take a high spot. No buffs for him, but maybe more nerfs.

Kalista, too.

Riot won't have to move as quickly as in the past to deal with large outliners, but the problem isn't removed, it just impacts the viewers less.","league-of-legends","0"
"395","Interesting thought but I honestly don't think it helps those projailed champions because if something is really strong in competitive, then it would probably be permabanned with neither team playing it at all, pretty much just taking away 1 ban slot from red side team.

Still, though, it would be a lot of work - they'd need new VAs and, while all legendaries have different models, a genderswap model would potentially be drastically different, which would be more work. 

There's also the question of, like, do you just make a genderswap of the base skin? Do you make an entire new skin line with it's own theme? There's no way they're getting 170+ new voice actors so they'd have to pick who's getting these, how do they pick and what kind of expectations would that set?

"432","I'm not an adc player but hover high gold/low plat. My take on Ashe is she is a utility adc kind of like Jhin. Your damage is not the best and you function as more of a supportive champ than the main carry unless you are ungodly fed. Ashe/Jhin are better in a more coordinated environment where your team can play around your ability to make picks with arrow/slows. Bronze elo is not that and there are much better picks to 1v9 irrespective of if your team is running it down or not. 

Ashe also has no mobility and relies on kiting your opponents effectively which if you are bronze you are not able to do. Like someone said Ashe actually requires more skill than other ADC champs for this reason.

At the end of the day I'd say if your goal is just climbing I'd play a different role. If you are actually better than other bronze players, playing a champ/role with more ability to get things done independently is the way to go instead of praying to god your support isn't a bot and you don't get 1 shot every teamfight.","league-of-legends","0"
"433","Yes, you can. Your inability to do so is quite literally a skill issue. Review your games, compare them to other high-elo ADC players and compare the build paths too.

  
Look at your positioning into fights, be more aware of enemy movement when they are on wards to predict flanks and ganks. Are you properly utilizing your maximum range and spacing yourself against the enemy properly, utilizing your skillset efficiently? 

  
These are some of the things that can be mentioned you need to improve upon.","league-of-legends","0"
"434","If you are winning lane and still unable to climb out of bronze as ADC, its because you are missing a lot of fundamentals on ADC and are probably making a ton of mistakes that you don't realize.

Especially on Ashe, Jax should never be reaching you. And Warwick's only chance to get to you should be when he ults.

It doesn't matter that your Malphite went full AP. He still engages hard, and its low elo so to be honest he probably is going to be more useful as AP than tank because nobody is going to respect his burst engage or build items to counter it, nor be capable of flashing it.  
You think if Malphite built tank, that would suddenly make Warwick and Jax stop running at you and instead randomly decide to beat on Malphite? Wrong.

There could be a dozen other things holding you back as well. Maybe your CSing is bad. Your kiting ability is almost certainly bad, because decent kiting ability is enough to get you out of bronze alone on Ashe even if everything else is bad.  
I would bet money that if you go watch some of your replays, you are almost certainly walking into melee range instead of walking AWAY from the enemy as you attack. I see it all the time, even in Gold.

It doesn't matter how often you get bad teammates.  
There is literally an equal chance for the enemy team to get just as bad teammates.  
If you play 100 games, thats 900 different players you have played with. 400 of them on your team, 500 on the enemy teams. If half of those players are horrendously bad, that means 200 of your teammates were really bad, and 250 of your enemies were really bad. So mathematically, you should be running into more bad enemies than allies. The only exception is.... if you are bad, then you are flipping that math the other way around.  
As long as you are not the weak link on your team, you should be at least climbing out of Bronze and Silver.

You will never be able to climb until you accept the raw fact that you have problems you need to work on, and begin working on them. You can complain about teammates for the next 5 years and its going to get you nowhere. On the other hand, checking every single game to make sure you are CSing more than the enemy ADC. Checking one replay after every session to watch a few of your deaths and see if you are walking into melee range or properly kiting. Spending time in the practice tool learning A > Left Click > Right Click to attack and move at the same time smoothly without errors.  
You will not just randomly get better at many of these skills by just playing more and more and more. You need to be honest with yourself, stop being egotistical, and put in the effort to grow these skills one at a time, and more.

You are always going to run into some games that are impossible to win because of teammates. But there is a similar amount of games you will run into where its a free win and you barely need to try.  
These games don't matter. The reason you are stuck in Bronze is because the games that could go either way are going bad more consistently. And the only consistent thing between all of your games: Is you.","league-of-legends","0"

Unintentionally they would tilt the team just from how they speak. That would lower their chance to win if they participate in voice chat or if they choose not to join it ( it would tilt the team from the inherent opt in aspect if they don't join voice chat).

"450","ChatGPT roasting Into the Emerald Dream:

Alright, here we go. Into the Emerald Dream — where every class suddenly becomes a Druid, and you can almost hear the devs saying, “Yeah, who needs class identity when we can just sprinkle a little bit of ‘dream magic’ on everything, right?” It’s like they looked at the class system and thought, “What if every class could just shapeshift into a Druid and have the exact same cards?” Bam, everyone’s a Druid now. That’s class design, baby!

And speaking of design, let’s talk about those new keywords. Imbue? Oh, great, now we get to “imbue” all our cards with something that sounds like a weak potion you’d find in a low-budget fantasy novel. “I’ve imbued my Hero Power with power!” Really? That’s it? Like, I don’t need a fancy term for ”I did a thing to make my cards better”. Just call it what it is: buff. But no, we have to pretend it’s all mystical, like you’re weaving together spells from ancient runes when, in reality, you’re just stacking stats like it’s your mom’s Tupperware collection.

Then we have Dark Gifts. Yeah, because nothing says “fresh and exciting gameplay” like giving us the ability to “embrace” the powers of the void or whatever, in exchange for... what, exactly? A couple more cards in hand? Oh, wow, I’m so blessed to get Dark Gifts. Are they wrapped in black lace and delivered by mysterious, spooky entities? Nah, they’re just more cards that don’t really do anything unless you’ve already built a combo deck to force it into action. Call me when my Dark Gifts come with an actual gift—like a free win, or maybe some dignity after playing this dream-induced mess.

Honestly, this whole expansion is like if someone locked you in a room full of dream journals from 2002 and told you to make a card set based on the first vague sentence you read. The entire thing is just one giant fever dream where nothing is quite what it seems, every class has the same cards, and we’re all just hoping to wake up from it before it gets any more ridiculous. But hey, at least we get to imbue our decks with a bunch of new nonsense, right?","hearthstone","0"
"451","My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you’re watching this tape, I’m probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn’t want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn’t know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a “hit” on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I’m a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can’t take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.","hearthstone","0"
"452","Dang. Wow. Holy macaroni. 60 packs? That’s a lot of packs. 60 packs contain 300 cards. That’s a lot of cards. Your typical Hearthstone™ deck features only 30 cards, the main exception being decks which include the legendary minion Prince Renethal from hit expansion Murder at Castle Nathria, which contain 40 cards. However this expansion has now rotated to the wild format, so as a standard player I will mostly be using 30 cards per deck. No more, and no less. 30 shall be the number of cards in a deck. This means that if I win these precious 300 cards, I can make 10 decks! Now you might think “who could possibly keep track of that many decks!”, but, and it might be wise to sit down for this one, blizzard has actually, in their eternal generosity, given us access to 18 whole deck slots. Nobody knows if it is actually possible to have this many decks at the same time without your mind exploding out of confusion. Now, as a seasoned Hearthstone™ player, I have already managed to gather a sizeable collection of 240 cards (pretty impressive I know), enough for exactly 8 decks. The implications of this are hard to believe. If I win one of these bundles, I may very well become the first player to fill every single deck slot. The consequences to my feeble mind may be severe as I try to manage them all, but I’m more than willing to subject myself to this experiment in the name of science. I wish everyone good luck! (Of course, everyone having good luck is a clear mathematical impossibility, but a man can dream)","hearthstone","0"

Instead of designing quests as an incentive to play the game, wether its standard, wild, twist, arena, BGs, casual, friendly matches - they rather choose to narrow it to a specific mode for some unknown reasons.

The change to weekly quests (from 5 ranked wins, up to 15, then down to 10, then to ""10 games played"" - and then fully reverting the system to its original state and not even keeping a good change like ""play"" instead of ""win"") with +200% requirements for +20% rewards, already showed that either some people are out of touch or they simply dont care a whole lot about players sentiment.","hearthstone","0"

"485","Your idea for changing the definition of ""starting hero power"" would never work because that would require them to instead come up with a brand new word to represent ""the base class's hero power"" in the context of cards like Justicar Trueheart, and this would require them to add new language and mechanics explaining why ""starting hero power and ""original hero power"" (or whatever they chose) are two legally different phrases.

"489","I think this is a cool idea and a much better way to handle the Rune system. It’s certainly possible to implement. However I think it’s more complicated than the devs want for this game. It also requires more balance testing because any triple rune card is actually 3 different cards and so on. It introduces even more variables.","hearthstone","0"
"490","I've had this idea in my head for like a year so I just needed to throw it out there. It would be cool if some DK cards had “empty” slots, meaning you could run them in a lot more rune combinations, but they’ll be weaker if you don’t meet the rune requirement. It would achieve the result of preventing players from running very powerful cards all in the same deck, while also allowing more flexibility with deck building. It also addresses the issue of only getting 10 cards a set but only certain runes getting support.

For example, Quartzite Crusher can only be run in UBF, BFF, BBF, but with empty slots weaker versions could also be run in BBB, BBU, BUU, FFF, FFU, etc.","hearthstone","0"
"491","I like this idea a lot. 

It makes sense. 
It allows for flexibility. 
It rewards players to play the way that the player wants. 

Most of all though, it means instead of the few cards that DK gets each expansion being split to fit different rune combinations, any DK card could potentially be used in any DK deck.

Definitely worth posting, and I hope that it is used going forward, if possible.","hearthstone","0"
"492","I like the idea, but that would mean a couple of things. 


1. Team 5 would have to essentially create multiple versions of each card.


2. Balance every neutral, DK, and possible DK discovery around every variation of these variant cards.

"501","The biggest potential problem I can see is the lack of good tempo defensive tools (except flutterwing guardian). Having time to play ensmallen (and then draw enough minions to make up the tempo loss) or play the mage location and not die in aggressive matchups may be tough. So 4 of your 3 drops are dead draws there. Then reforestation is slow to draw 2, at 3 turns in hand, and is a downturn tempo wise too. Ensmallen is what I'm least excited about personally.. Reduces damage of your minions and you don't have many high cost+attack or high impact minions to come down and regain the dead turn 3.

I saw mention of ogre in the comments with him being a placeholder, and, the evergreen stag- A 6/7 for 6 (or 5/7 for 5 with ensmallen) elusive lifesteal taunt may be worth considering. That or sunfury protector from core to taunt up 2 hero powers, or a hero power and another body if you can get it/have it on board. Sing a long buddy>hero power>sunfury is a pretty good turn if you've got your hero power to a decent size and it protects sing a long for next turn potentially too which could snowball the game turn 6 and 7. Mark of the wild is also worth considering as a nature spell and taunt activator but I feel is weaker than the other 2 options on the whole, especially with a lack of 1 drops to target on turn 2. Sunfury feels like the winner for me here as it's low cost and can give 2 taunts for 1 card.

There's Shaladrassil too. Whether it's good or not I'm not sure, as 7 mana seems really high in a deck that wants to hero power practically every turn.. But shaladrassil is 3 nature spells, a good amount of tempo/value late game, and potentially one of the only board clears available to nature shaman.

Just my thoughts anyway, and last of all- have fun!","hearthstone","0"

"520","I think if we look at the expansion in a vacuum, it's a great card in a slow meta (aka what the cards are promoting this expansion). However, Turn 8 is just very late into the game when looking at it through the lens of standard. For that reason, this seems like a weak, but very fun card. 

I would've liked to see Malorne be 7 Mana, but maybe lower its stats a bit as balance, that way you can have a powerful turn 8. Turn 8 is roughly how long games in HS have lasted on average throughout its life cycle. So I would've liked to see Malorne at 7 to make it more likely that it sees play in more games. 

Imbue as a whole seems like it's geared towards slower games, so maybe the decks are going to be well equipped enough as is to allow Malorne to see play.","hearthstone","0"
"521","Depends on if the meta actually slows down like they are trying to do. I have hopes this card will actually be very good, especially in shaman with shudder, this could get pretty crazy","hearthstone","0"
"522","I think its actually good. Maybe not really good, but it's flexible and you're inly dropping it for 1. If there's enough bounce/copy cards, it's actually much better. 

I think I'd treat it as a 10 drop and combo it with w.e wild God I can get. The only thing is I think we have to see how fast games go. Off design I think they intend for games to go longer, since new Ysera is there. But with Charge back, even though it's Dark Gift luck, that could all change. Clone cards are strong there too

You could grab Goldrinn and run face with beasts to end the game. (He doubles damage from beasts)","hearthstone","0"
"523","With 8 imbue cards in most classes, it's probably reasonable to include in an imbue deck.

"524","Not sure why they even concede. Silencing a cat only remove half their power. Considering Rogue limited access to healing and taunt, I'd say this is still very winnable for the Druid.

Draft a faster deck (lower curve) rather than slower (also take prio card draw)  
Make sure you have early game and keep pushing

Classes like Paladin, Shaman, Mage, Druid, Priest, Warrior have heavy healing possitblites, so you might get trapped if you go face and think you only win by that.

Think what you can do this turn together with what your plan is next turn.

Once rotation happens, then yes, you can dust your originals *if you want to*, but bear two things in mind.

1. When the Core Set ones rotate back out, you'd no longer have the card unless you recraft it. This is at least a year in the future, so you may decide this isn't something worth worrying about, but it is something you should consider.

2. In certain scenarios, such as Twist* and the occasional Brawl, you can't use the Core version. Again, this may not be a concern, but you should be aware of it.

No. You can also wait and get dust gradually. Dusting willy-nilly without refund benefits is very wasteful.

"580","You'll always find people who say never do this, or always do that, but it really depends on circumstances.

The game's supposed to be fun. The absolute minimum you need is One Good Deck that you enjoy. If you don't have that, do whatever it takes to get it.

On all of the other decisions, play the odds. What are the odds you might like Class X, which you hate now, in a year's time? If you're totally new, you may have no idea, so play for a while and get a better feel for Class X before you make a drastic decision. If you have your One Good Deck you can afford to do that. And if you still hate Class X by the time you're totally bored with your Good Deck (or it's stopped being a Good Deck) then go ahead and dust Class X. The more you enjoy the game, the more likely you are to have the dust you need if you ever do change your mind.

The same applies to rules like ""Only dust when something is nerfed"". It's good advice, but if you don't have an interesting Good Deck right now, it's probably not the best advice, because the best way of getting more decks is by playing more, and that won't happen if you're not enjoying the game. (At least it shouldn't happen, the game's supposed to be fun).

Oh, and while you have a small collection, the gold you have should probably be spent on maximising the number of cards you have, not the amount of dust you have. So although, again, the ""Buy the Miniset for dust"" is good advice, it's probably not the best advice for you personally right now.

On which class to dust if you ever do, what playstyles do you prefer? How do you feel about RNG (like it or hate it?)","hearthstone","0"

"582","i think you’re in a tough spot just because the expansion is right around the corner and we don’t know which decks will be good or not. i don’t mind you dusting DH even though it might have been hasty. as a F2P you’re gonna have to plan how you use your resources. for example the upcoming into the emerald dream has neutral imbue cards and neutral dark gift cards. since those are the probable arche types of this expansion, they have higher priority (like the star craft for multiple factions for example). the other advice i can give you is not to disenchant classes you don’t like but rather focus on your fav class first 

for me i started (in perils) -> 
triple frost DK (budget) -> double frost unholy (adding legendaries like helya) -> starship/rainbow control DK -> starship rogue -> cycle rogue (rip my beloved). most of the time i played a cheap solid deck and gradually added legendaries. sometimes i got greedy and disenchanted other decks but i feel like it paid off for me in enjoyment 

the other thing you should focus on imo is the sheer amount of free stuff you can get. do your quests, collect the free packs for the expansion, do tavern brawls etc. it’ll take about 2 expansions but you do it all f2p 

furthermore we’re close to rotation meaning the card pool is gonna shrink significantly making it the perfect timing to start growing your collection","hearthstone","0"

That said I don’t have a complete picture of meta’s during the last 2-3 years. 
I enjoyed the SC miniset. Of course I played Zerg DK, who hasn’t. 
The deck is not busted because of infestor, it’s busted because you’re able to trigger it’s deathrattle too many times or reborn it too many times. It’s busted because you summon cheap shit that has too many stats like 0-1 mana summon 2x 8/8 zerglings or larger, or a huge baneling + reborn, or a huge lurker. The fact that you can reborn an entire 8/8+ board with viper. Or the fact that after you reborn your minions they have more than 1 hp. 

In standard the deck will loose the yodeler. I think it’s fine. 
The zergling nerf is fine. It alleviates some of the problems in standard + wild. Also solves some bullshit from the hunter deck. 
8 mana Kerrigan is fine. 

However removing the health buff from infestor is too much. Maybe they should have “reworked” the reborn effect so that it would work as intended, i.e. resummon the zergs with just 1 hp and no health aura. Only with attack aura. 

I mean I get it, the plan for zergs is too swarm the board. You will swarm it for sure, but the minions will be removed too easy.

As for wild sure, the deck was strong. Maybe a bit too strong but after the nerfs it will just be unplayable.","hearthstone","0"
"593","Some imbues are basically capped, for example, once you have imbued 10 times as a priest player, your hero power doesn't benefit from any further imbues, you don't get offered minions that cost more than 10 for a more than 10 mana reduction. Same with Paladin.

Shaman can't get minions over 10 mana either, I believe, so they are effectively capped too.

Hunter, Mage and Druid are the ones that have a bit that seems to be effectively uncapped. 

Having said that, Hunter and Mage can only play so many imbue cards (4 neutral minions, and 4 class minions).

Druid is the only one that seems to be truly uncapped if you are using [[Hamuul Runetotem]] and generating a lot of nature spells. They did seem to try to make that a bit harder by printing some not so great nature spells this expansion.

It is looking to be shaping up to be a slower meta, but there are faster decks that should (hopefully!) prevent Druid from getting to the very extreme.

I could be wrong though.","hearthstone","0"
"594","druid is already basically doing this with HP druid. is having so much power based around a resource that doesnt go away each turn very strong? yes. are there tech options to work with it? not sure if in standard but yes in wild","hearthstone","0"
"595","Nah it's fine. Hero powers have been useless for years now. Hero powers are so weak that even when Baku and Genn were temporarily in standard again, they didn't see play. Imbue seems great. You've got a run some pretty meh minions for the most part in order to imbue your HP too.","hearthstone","0"
"596","If you're a new player with a very small card collection, keep your gold for the expansion.

"597","What happens if you buy a starcraft mini set eg standard too poor for gold and you have queen of blades already?

"598","If you do not yet own the mini-set, it would be best to spend your gold on getting it. But if you do already own the miniset and are thinking about getting the zerg set just for the dust, it depends:

If you want to be efficient with your gold, you'll want to make sure you have enough gold to get all the rares for the new expansion. Worst-case scenario that will take 38 packs, but probably fewer than that. (It is more gold-efficient to open these cards from packs than to craft them using dust.)

If you have all the commons/rares for the new expansion, then it depends on if you want to keep opening new expansion packs for a chance at the new epic/legendary cards you want, or if you really just want the dust to craft what you want. On average a pack gives you 100 dust for 100 gold. With the nerf refunds, the zerg set will get you close to 200 dust per 100 gold spent. From a pure dust perspective, the zerg set is twice as good.","hearthstone","0"

"604","This is very similar to fishing priest. There is only 1 new card here from emerald dream here though no? Idk whats the point of calling it a new expansion deck tbh.

Also id argue your version of this deck is not optimized imo. 

no need for the 4 mana lifesteal spell. U lose the game if u dont kill ur opponent by turn 7 anyways so u dont care about the life steal ever.. not to mention how expensive it is for how much damage it deals.  Id play lower mana cost anything else for even better tempo. Such as the 1 cost 2/4 that damages you when it takes damage from perils in paradise + its another 1 drop for turn 1 or another fishing target. And also the 3 drop that summons a copy of itself when u take damage should go hand in hand too. 


Some other extra cards to consider would be,

-the spell that silencess your own minnions and gives them a +1+2 

-2 mana minnion from hunter that replays your last 1 cost card. 

(Sry for not giving names to these cards but i cant remember all of their names off the top of my head rn)","hearthstone","0"

"608","Shaman, straight up. Simply because of shudderblock and incindius.

All other decks are borderline useless outside of their very specific archetype or belong to classes like warrior which are quite expensive to build.

That being said if you can wait until the set rotation to maybe get more up to date loaner decks without rotating cards that would be for the best","hearthstone","0"
"609","It's easily warrior for pure value. 


Warrior has a strong control archetype in most expansions. This deck gives you quite a few core cards to the general playstyle. You'll also get significant dust once the announced nerfs hit, allowing you to recraft anything you want with it.


It also provides core neutral cards for any other class that plays the game. So it's also the most flexible.


Even aggro Decks use some of those core cards warrior provides. 


Or. Alternatively, going through the list. Death Knight is little value, with one of the legendaries given out for free. 


Asteroid is a strong deck, but will only let you play shaman, and only asteroid shaman. Very few cards translate to other classes, or even other shaman Decks.


Paladin isn't played right now.


Hunter and mage has the same issue shaman does. Less so  because the cards are slightly better. But you'd better enjoy the playstyle because that's what you're playing.


I'd rank those options, warrior >>>>> hunter >> mage = shaman


Right now, before the nerfs, with the starcraft bundle & warrior, you'll have a few meta Decks 95% complete.","hearthstone","0"
"610","I think they are being cautious, which is fine, but I'm alarmed by the lack of caution to protoss mage. It's one of the least interactive decks in the rotation and if it edges its way under the radar and gains even a semblance of relevance, that is not fun for anyone.","hearthstone","0"
"611","nothing has changed, including its top tier performance despite its low popularity. it's a very strong deck and this patch focused on everything the devs thought might dominate a new meta.

all in all, fairly reasonable nerfs. not my biggest disagreement with the new patch by a good margin.","hearthstone","0"
"612","It is currently a strong win-con, people just don't seem to enjoy playing it. I am assuming T5 is slowing down Zarimi because they are expecting the meta to slow down after rotation, but that is just a guess.","hearthstone","0"
"613","It's been tier 1 for a while it's just that no one plays the deck and they're also releasing a decent chunk of dragons in the new expansion, so they're preemptively nerfing it","hearthstone","0"

"633","You can put this into anything, but it will make the deck worse. 

The spore's expensive 5 cost and the average medicore quality of 5-cost is already bad, but then after that you have to ruin one of your draws with the card that generates them.

"634","The StarCraft cards are remaining in the game, but the Terran and Zerg factions are being nerfed in the upcoming patch so we’ll have to wait and see if they remain relevant - my thinking is that the answer is yeah they’re pretty likely to but will hopefully be more balanced","hearthstone","0"
"635","They couldn’t come up with anything related to the hero power? If they’re changing the effect this much, they might as well have just deleted Raza and added a new minion.

"648","The Priest set sucks overall, but I'd argue this is the strongest Imbue. You'll typically get a proactive and a reactive option, so this is rarely dead. Value-generating hero powers have been very impactful in the past. Even the 1 in 5 that Boom would create a card was meta-defining, let alone consistently, a strong pool (class only) and with a scaling discount (you can even find more imbues). 

Having infinite resources available means you can build a really light and consistent deck. This also avoids the draw inconsistencies that you had with Hero cards, since you can run several Imbues. I'm gonna say the weak Priest set means it won't be strong right away, but it will be a menace in later sets.","hearthstone","0"

"662","I returned recently and got tons of catch-up packs and one of those ""welcome back"" gift things, I imagine you'd probably get even more than I did.

"663","Well I just started playing last month for the first time myself, but if i'm understanding correctly, the new set will be releasing next week and 3 of the oldest sets will be rotating out of the standard play set. Also they will nerfing a bunch of the current meta cards. So it might make sense to just wait until next week. 

The game seems to be f2p friendly more or less. That is, you can build some good meta decks that will let you be competitive with other players. I really wanted to hit legend so I ended up spending some money so that I could build a good terran shaman deck. But even as a brand new player I was able to climb up to diamond pretty easily with decks I built for free.","hearthstone","0"

Anyways, the game has changed a lot, and it's way more f2p friendly now than ever was before. So, it's lots of fun, but the way the game plays is very different, I feel like it's way more complex than before, if you wanna get high legend you really need to know what plot twist the enemy will have in their hands to surprise you after you waste your resources. I feel like there is less t1 decks too, so less diversity of classes per patch, it's not always, but been like this for these last months.","hearthstone","0"

To be fair this is a very low result kind of thing due to the cards rarity but I can already see people wanting this in the future due to this one time to happen with other examples.

It really isnt the same logic since one card in its effect summons the nerfed tokens; thats a direct nerf to a card. The other gots its pool of cards it draws nerfed; but since those already give you full dust i dont see a reasonm to make it effect the draw aswell.","hearthstone","0"
"673","If anything, this set has showed how Choose One is such a limiting keyword from a creative viewpoint. Basically all of the classes' Choose One cards have basically been ""Do this generic bland thing or do this generic bland thing""","hearthstone","0"
"674","Hmm i think people are really underestimating these choose one cards. Theres a couple of the 4/5 mana ones that are like half the power of existing cards but this is a perfectly decent card. Same with the whirlwind reprint and the 2x1/1 for dk, its so convenient having 2 decent cards in one. Take the dh wildseed one for example, even if 90% of the time youre choosing the first option its nice to have backup que built into your feck","hearthstone","0"
"675","Hot take: people are underrating how nice choose one is, even when the effects seem bland. Think about wrath. Back when it saw play, each individual effect was mediocre on its own (worse frostbolt or worse mortal coil), but together they made a flexible card. I think cards like this, which are usable in vastly different board states, will succeed for the same reasons","hearthstone","0"
"676","Pretty terrible card now. You're giving your opponent 3 coins and they get to keep the minion plus you have to spend your own mana next turn to play it still. Bob's really just a 6 mana frost nova now. I'm guessing he's getting cut from most decks.","hearthstone","0"
"677"," RIP Bob. Could have at least added it costs (1) or (3) less or something to make it survivable. It’s just an expansive frost nova without a buff to the other 2 options that no one even remembers existing","hearthstone","0"
"678","if they wanted to keep the flavor maybe it could have been you immediately summon it for yourself? with rush even if they wanted. The coins worked since it was a 6 cost 4/5 removal + get a minion, copying a minion at the cost of 6 mana and giving your opponent 3 coins is insane, even if you mill a card from them it's still just too bad now. Hell, maybe rework it entirely, make it so you get three coins and sap the enemy minion back to their hand? Just copying is not enough, bob was an annoying removal and steal being thrown in when we just getting rid of yogg and reska but he was still a cool idea. Just make him do something else that's still decent.","hearthstone","0"
"679","Everyone just fucking complains all the god damn time here. “Bob is too OP” - HS nerfs the thing people hate about Bob - “What the hell? Why would you ever play this card it sucks”

"686","I think, if ever there was a time to come back now is a good one.

The new set comes with a massive balance patch that heavily nerfs infestor along with most other meta relevant cards from the previous format. 

The rotation and naturally smaller card pool means it will be easier to keep up with standard starting now, as opposed to had you started when there were already 2-3 additional sets in the format from the previous year.","hearthstone","0"

"688","What kinda annoys me is the following:

Yeah this card was trash, but we usually have some really powerful stuff at the beginning of expansions anyway. 
So I'm kinda annoyed they preemtively changed it. It would've been really cool to allowed infinite miricale priest for at least somr days. 
That being said, the card is probably even worse now. 
Yes I get my 1600 dust, but I was kinda looking forward to try priest.","hearthstone","0"

"693","This would've been crazy with funnel cake. Even right now it sets up lethal very easily. Damage stacks up very fast with chrono boost, a buff spell and hallucination. And if youre going to use random burn spells its basically a prophet velen that can't be removed","hearthstone","0"
"694","Well, it's 24 damage (12 extra) next turn when combined with 3x a combination of Void Shard & Acupuncture. Especially in some kind of active playstyle with this as finisher. Not sure how good that will be though.

Don't see any other spells worth casting 3 times yet. Maybe Hot Coals for board clear + damage?

Without support and with the currently released cards it's probably not good enough, but it could be incredibly strong with the right support.","hearthstone","0"

Paging u/RidiculousHat","hearthstone","0"
"699","Seeing all the cards rotating into wild that are getting unnerfed really puts into perspective just how aggressive Team 5 has been with balance changes over the last year or two.

Cards from these 3 expansions will rotate out on March 25, so you should not craft cards or buy packs from them:

* *Festival of Legends*
* *TITANS*
* *Showdown in Badlands*

The newest mini set is the heroes of Starcraft one, which is quite popular and has cards that will get nerfed soon (and hence will be full refundable), so you should buy that one. You should save remaining gold for packs of the upcoming expansion, Emerald Dream.

Check out Hearthstone mathematics on youtube, they upload videos which tell you exactly what to buy in which order.","hearthstone","0"

Then try to Save up 1200 G to spend on the Zerg Faction one 1200 G which will get you atleast 2000+ Dust","hearthstone","0"
"705","In light of recently announced nerfs, if you don't have the starcraft miniset I'd say buy it and then buy the terran and zerg bundles separately.

"711","I can't go back to the game after the realization that this is a video game not a card game. It always held the allure of a good TCG for me. The thrill of that random next draw and how I'm weaving it into my game plan. Value trades, off numbers and over under plays. If you're at all watching the theory craft it is more egregious than ever. I've never seen the game produce answers at the rate it is. It should be the best season ever for rogues to have fun and I was excited. However I saw it's face for what it is, a game that's playing me out of time and money claiming to be a digital TCG. It's not, it's a gacha video game, end of story.","hearthstone","0"
"712","the strangest thing here is that it does not shuffle the card into your deck. He places this card in a random place in the deck. The deck is not shuffled and the order of the cards does not change (at least it was a year ago when I tested it)","hearthstone","0"

At the very least they could introduce something similar to what LoR did, and you would be able to see every related cards when you hover over a card

"716","No, this is actually in the top-3 worst worded cards in HS. When they revealed it, i thought it meant


Start of the game: shuffle Mankirk's wife into your deck (she WAS last seen somewhere in your deck - means she WAS there before, cannot possibly mean she is only now getting shuffled, unless time travel is involved)


Battlecry: Draw her (Battlecry: Help Mankirk - means it happens now. Imagine if ""Battlecry: Draw a card"" meant you will maybe draw a card sometime later in the game)","hearthstone","0"

"718","popgar gives both reach and healing, it's the most consistent by far. Vona is fun if you can activate it, but good luck surviving against mage after doing 8 self damage.","hearthstone","0"
"719","You want imideate effect, for little conditions for it to be good, whle your opponent not being able to abuse your cards (by copying etc)

"720","Conditional 3-mana 3/3 that does 3 damage. We’ve seen it before and it’s been fine. I think Priest will like it because they do want board control for a reactive deck, which large spells always fit in. 

Hilariously, this card can’t activate after you trigger Aviana. Though at that point, I don’t think it matters.","hearthstone","0"
"721","Considering the power level of the rest of the set, this seems pretty good in comparison, would definitely see play if they manage to bring past sets power level to this one through the nerfs","hearthstone","0"
"722","My biggest issue with this effect that on turn 3 most of the threatening minions that would want to remove asap especially 3 drops, have 4 or even 5 hp. This isn’t 2018 where 3 drops have 4/3 stats across the board.","hearthstone","0"
"723","A card like Amber Whelp already has this same effect with the dragon condition instead of spell. Other cards have this effect too. Maybe this can be more flexible in a deck since it only requires a spell, so it changes how deck building works, but I'm a bit skeptical tbh. 5 Mana condition might be harder than just having a dragon. Also, most of these 3 Mana deal 3s are often just whatever cards. Might be a good card contextually in a deck though so definitely don't write this card off just yet.","hearthstone","0"
"724","I feel like we are far enough into the game's life cycle that these sort of conditional minions either should have no condition or have spider tank stats. Compared to something like Primal Dungeoneer, this effect feels not worth the hassle.","hearthstone","0"
"725","If this can be activated on turn 5, it’s pretty damn good. There are some bad 6 drops, plenty that rely on battlecry to be good, but you can also get Dread Deserter and get a charger on 5. 

My main statement is I like the design behind this and the other new moon cards, I guess I wish there was more too it then just what’s been shown.","hearthstone","0"
"726","In comparison, for 1 more mana and an easier to satisfy condition, Death Knight can reliably summon two 5/5s with Taunt and gain 10 max health. Without the inevitable low rolls that come with a card like this, which will most likely not be charged and ready to go on T5 because Priest tends to have slow, conditional spells.

Don't have much faith in this one.","hearthstone","0"
"727","At first, I thought this card was so-so.  But on more thought, it's not bad, but I could live without the random (I'd have preferred even a double discover instead).  That said, it could find a home in Zarimi (turn 10 Zarimi into a Ritual) gives you that extra punch if you didn't play/level Gorgonzormu.","hearthstone","0"
"728","Do you have to have this card in hand to activate it? I imagine you do... In which case it's 5 mana build-a-board which is okay I guess. If they truly do nerf everything into the ground like they say they will then this MIGHT be playable, but I'm not holding my breath.","hearthstone","0"
"729","I can see this slotting into both aggressive and control style priest lists tbh. Good tempo is good tempo and all decks like to have it. There's a nice shell of cheap spells already used in some priest decks so I see this as an obvious inclusion in similar decks come rotation.","hearthstone","0"

"731","Aww you lost your super oppressive deck that builds insane reborn boards and disrupts hands for 4 mana total? No more coin infestor plays ? No more reska + yodler to steal their whole board. And to top it all off you can't even summon any 20/20 zerglings anymore to beat your helpless opponent to a pulp without any possible counterplay from them. Damn man... That's so unfair... I feel really bad for you.

"732","Sad but true. DK zerg are not aggro. But hunter is, and i suppose the nerf was aimed at them. However i don't see it the difference \balanced\nerf when summoning 1 instead of a copy is the same since hunter throws a spell you dead if you didn't clear the board. Dk seems (ill see when the patch drops) unnecessary hit while terrans seem still overpowered...

If u ask me, take a battlecry or death rattle from the mothership, or limit mage double damage to some value. ""Balance patch"" my nuts","hearthstone","0"
"733","1) you are confusing Protoss with Terran.
2) they both, zerg and terran, got hit hard and deservly so:
Zerg Lost handbuff cheese and the Reborn strat is much, much weaker. 


Terran got the pieces nerfed by a significant amount. They still might be able to nuke boards but 
A) Poison and/or lifesteal is less likely, which means less launch swings
B) They don't kill you in the process by also going face with their pieces


Protoss Priest/Mage/Druid/Rogue might surge as meta tyrants but they are the One that most relied on their Hero card coming out faster (especially druid) than other factions. ","hearthstone","0"
"734","Sentiment outliers seem to be the most difficult thing for Hearthstone Redditors to grasp

"737","Problem is how often can you trigger the effect

Historically, it would be pretty easy for priest, but right now the class barely has good cheap spells outside of like, the drink from perils

Highly depends on the rest of the set, but they are the priest inbue cards so I doubt they can save this one (unless the hero power generates spells, which seems plausible, ""add an X cost sipell to your hand, it costs 0"" or something)","hearthstone","0"
"738","More Priest anti-synergy cards.  As a Priest main, I guess I should just come to expect it.  So many other ways to make this better, not the least of which is Spell School to Shadow/Holy.  It's like Whirlpool (Nature) spell school all over again - they throw out a SC from another class then never do anything with it.","hearthstone","0"
"739","Are they planning to give Priest some kind of big spell finisher? These cheap spells that care about casting spells are interesting, but this can't go face for a Tyrande burn plan and the other legend is a setup, not a payoff. These cards just seem odd, especially compared to how many powerful top end threats other classes have gotten.","hearthstone","0"
"740","So the other spell stone like card was a bad midrange tempo card and this looks like a prob  fine control card. Tea makes this really easy to cast 3 spells so it prob sees play since all of Priests good control tools left so it wants any that it can get. 

It being arcane sucks since we cant tutor it from our 5/5 taunt too :(","hearthstone","0"
"741","I mean, why did they even print Raza in the first place? The card had no synergies in Standard for an entire year. 

The devs clearly have no idea what they’re doing with Priest. ","hearthstone","0"
"742","now, if i may put my conspiracy hat on for a second:

  
i think when they plan the next year of expansion they just put it on paper, they put the idea down, they write down a napkin, basically just get the whole concept, maybe even abilities up while they are working on this year expansion, so my guess is that back late 2023-early 2024, when the expansion was being visualized, they did not have the ability to play test it, so they just assumed the mechanic wouldn't cause any problem, flashback to late 2024-early 2025 and as the dev are putting the emerald dream into actual code they realize ""oh, oh fuck no, no we can't have this interaction"" and changed it

  
is this a error from the team? absolutely, i think their process most likely puts it that next year expansion are put on paper and then only began to put into actual mechanics when they finishing the last expansion or miniset of the year, it absolutely not a clean execution and i think it might have been worth just going for a different way of doing the priest imbue power than basically  making raza the unsealed be raza the warsong comander","hearthstone","0"
"743","The devs had said previously that they tend to look about 2 expansions in the future. So while Raza was being sealed up and sent print, they were probably in the middle of the design for GDB and flirting with the idea of the Emerald Dream expansion. Even if they knew they wanted a hero power based expansion, they likely didn’t land on this idea until long after Raza was released.","hearthstone","0"
"744","Wrong way around. The real question is why did they design priests hero power like this knowing raza exists in standard. They could have just… made it not an infinite value generator, made priest a dark gift class, whatever they wanted, no one forced them to make this","hearthstone","0"
"745","Raza died for this bruh🤣. Considering raza priest in wild had like a 20% playrate at some point even though it was like low tier 2 i know a ton of people are upset (but give me that 1600dust man idgaf)","hearthstone","0"
"746","If ya also wanna fuck round with a deck that's a lilbit risky but fun to win with, try putting in Nozdormu along with E.T.C band manager (your opponent won't discover your chosen cards) and either chaotic tentacles or Arch Villian Rafaam.

"751","I have done this achievement on several accounts. My method is probably different than most. Rather than try to win games, which can take awhile, I would seek to lose them as fast as possible. So I made a warlock with what I call self hurt cards. The goal being to kill yourself by turn 3-5. And it is actually very easy to do.

Now with one of the legendary cards needed and added to your deck, each game will net you some points as you seek to get to the total 7200. Also while your doing that you will get other golden cards awarded to you along the way, wild of course, for a few different classes.

Another thing you can do is when you get daily quests for play 3 warlock games, that's always nice to knock out real quick with this deck, no need to win. Hero power quests, mana quests, battlecry quests, shadow spell, other misc. quests can be done with this deck.

This achievement will take some time, but the games go quick, and usually what I did was just read or watch stuff online while knocking them out, with quests sometimes, etc. Depending on how much you go at it, could be a month, or could be longer. Id say for myself it was one of the two, a month or so.

Here is the deck I made, I had vandar added but drek'thar is actually better for it. I don't have him or I would have added him.

"752","At the moment standard is absolutely terrible thanks to the Starcraft cards, but there are nerfs on the way and a lot of other annoying cards are going out of rotation as well with the next expansion.

It's largely going to depend on how the new cards turn out, but it's looking pretty good so far. At least a lot better than it has been.","hearthstone","0"
"753","Hard to say. Unfortunately the StarCraft cards actually reduced the number of viable decks. Great Dark Beyond was actually a quite varied and interesting meta, but people complained because they didn’t understand asteroid shaman.","hearthstone","0"
"754","Not at the moment, right now skill expression is about as low as it can get without becoming Candyland. It feels impossible to manipulate the outcome of the game beyond the luck of the draw. There are very few “hard choices”, you either make the nearly obvious right play or you play terrible, which is not common among my MMR. I’ve reached legend for 10 months in a row now, but I think this might be the month I take a break from it.

Keep in mind that this is a vibe check, I’m not looking at any data with this opinion, just how the game feels to me right now.","hearthstone","0"
"755","We will have to find out in 2 weeks whether or not the new cards (which look really fun) will keep up with the starcraft mini set that just completely took over standard. 

If you plan on playing wild with what I assume is a old collection since you’ve been gone a while, you can do whatever you want so there’s nothing stopping you on that front. 

Just don’t craft a single thing until rotation happens but I don’t think you needed me to tell you that.","hearthstone","0"
"756","As the others have said, zerg and terran decks are just overpowered and you basically stop playing classes and just play the archetypes that dont vary amongst different characters. There are, as always, interesting decks (i. e. Highlander druid, bran warrior) but these are just terrible to climb with as they are too slow and too clunky for the meta.","hearthstone","0"
"757","Cool little video. Probably means that these will only be available via a bundle purchase like the StarCraft Hero cards. 

Which is a shame, I really wanted to get that Tyrande Signature.

Edit: Description confirms purchasable in the shot for Tyrande and Naralex. Curator is given out for free.","hearthstone","0"
"758","I mean they really do look incredible good. So you can buy them in the shop, so does that mean.. you cant open them from packs?

Also, a cinematic for cosmetics. Wow.","hearthstone","0"
"759","Im curious as to how much itd be for the entire normal set. 🤔 Comparing the options to see which one is more worth the investment if im a little short of 12k gold","hearthstone","0"
"760","You would really have to hope that your legendaries favour you well. Absolutely no reason why you couldn't have two or three competitive decks in the middle of that expansion, but it will take some disenchanting and management of resources.","hearthstone","0"
"761","If you don't have any gold and dust saved, probably? I play f2p, and I save enough gold by each expansion's release to buy 40 packs when it launches (same as a preorder bundle). By the middle of the expansion, I've had all rares and a decent number of epics. So getting the bundle fast tracks your collection. 


However, I'd like to point out that I usually go for the cheaper meta decks or at least the ones that need the least amount of missing epics/legendaries.","hearthstone","0"
"762","It should help you out to have some sort of foundation to atleast stand on, but an idea if not out of ur financial range ( you stated you don't want to buy the 80$ one due to cosmetics not the price), buy the golden starcraft miniset for 80$ instead. Okay you won't get the excitement to open new cards and maybe legendaries BUT there's no better bang for your buck, if you disenchant all of it after the nerfs you're looking at just shy of 22k dust. That 22k dust can surely craft you a handful of decks going into the next expansion","hearthstone","0"
"763","Generally speaking, it's a good idea to buy 10 packs from any expansion because you are guaranteed your first legendary from that set within the first 10 packs. You could save some gold by doing this piecemeal, too, until you get your first legendary and then move along to another expansion.

Assuming you intend to play standard, the Festival of Legends, TITANS, and Showdown in the Badlands expansions rotate out of standard next week (25/3) so they are not worth investing in if you intend to focus on standard. However, if you just want to get some dust for crafting other cards, you could try the piecemeal approach until you get your first legendary from those expansions and dust what you open.

The expansions that will remain in standard after 25 March are Whizbang's Workshop, Perils in Paradise, The Great Dark Beyond, and the upcoming (25/3) release of Into the Emerald Dream. Assuming standard is your focus, those are the expansions worth investing more of your resources in. According to Hearthstone Mathematics' data, the Whizbang and Perils sets have been the most influential in terms of power-level, but it's difficult to tell how influential they will remain once Emerald Dream releases. Pre-order bundles are a great opportunity to stockpile cards and dust––that is the best value Hearthstone offers. If you don't want either the $80 or $50 options, there is usually a $20 option after the expansion releases which includes 20 packs and 2 guaranteed legendaries.

Lastly, if you have 2,500G on your account and are in need of dust, the Starcraft mini-set will be receiving significant nerfs and for two weeks afterwards the nerfed cards will refund full dust value. So, if you just want dust to craft the cards that most interest you, that's also a worthwhile investment. Regarding the two mini-sets from the other two expansions remaining in standard, it is only worth buying a mini-set that contains legendaries or epics in decks you actually want to play. ""Traveling Travel Agency"" and ""Dr Boom's"" mini-sets contain cards that see play in some decks but typically restricted (in terms of efficacy) to a few classes (e.g., Druid, DK). If you don't play those classes, don't bother; if you'd like to, it's worth getting the respective mini-sets.

Other than that, I'd recommend perusing [hsguru.com](http://hsguru.com), [hearthstonetopdecks.com](http://hearthstonetopdecks.com), or [hsreplay.net](http://hsreplay.net) to target decks and cards that interest you most. Best wishes","hearthstone","0"
"764","Did some math on this for those wondering (reference values are in CAD pricing). For reference:

"767","I have saved couple of my Nozdormu daily quests for the new expansion and my opponent played this lol. No more tavern brawl for me this week, glad I haven't been over eager for the new expansion by already playing 2 out of the 3 games with Noz.","hearthstone","0"
"768","Ngl, if you think that’s insane u gotta play against Wild Hero Power Protoss. They can dupe the Groofy like here, but also use the 6 Mana spell to revive all his 1 or 2 Mana that dies this game, well- if his only minions that costs 2 or less is Groofy u have a Very Fun time…","hearthstone","0"
"769","hitting cats on discover is very lucky but to be fair, with the right draw and setup you can output even more damage with only 2 groovy cats:

step 1- play artanis
step 2-  play singalong, hero power, refresh hero power, hero power again for 8 mana -> 20 swing damage plus 20 damage buff on a minion = 40 total","hearthstone","0"
"770","i agree with you. another example of this, while not quite the same situation, was with excavation cards. some classes had a legendary excavation treasure while some didnt. it always struck me as odd they add in this new cool feature and not every class can utilize it to its full potential. my two favorite classes are warlock and death knight and neither get any kind of imbued hero power stuff.

i was under the impression that every class had an imbued hero power, bcs i just figured thatd make sense. i wish theyd just start letting every class have access to the cool new keywords. the game is already at ludicrous levels of power, so why not stir the pot more.","hearthstone","0"
"771","They're probably going to make it impossible to generate imbue cards in classes that don't have that mechanic (like how you can't generate c'thun or galakrond stuff if those cards didn't start in your deck).

That would still make them useless if you stole them, but that's ok. Cards you steal from your opponent are already often useless.","hearthstone","0"
"772","The worst part in my opinion is that while all classes with access to Imbue have these whole new packages around the new mechanic (some stronger, some weaker) and have atleast 1 payoff card.
But the classes with dark gift cant even utilize it and no class beside Warlock have any payoff cards for dark gift. So whats the point/incentive to run dark gift overall?","hearthstone","0"
"773","If you are super nice to blizzard support they might help you out. They would do stuff like this in the past. Especially if you are a spender or heavy player.","hearthstone","0"
"774","Best bet is probably to pair it with the charge and hallucination strategy. So i propose 2 orbital halos. Thats potentially 2 free procs and 39 damage for 8 mana if you go Angel hp 1, Chronoboost hp 6, orbital halo hp 10, orbital halo hp 14, hallucination hp 26, hallcination hp 39 dmg.

So 39 damage for 8 mana with 6 of it being attached to your hero in optimal conditions. With sing along buddy its 10 mana 12 + 45 damage.

I’d drop deckhand and fan club first probably.

Maybe change gift and armor vendor for the snake oil 2/2 dude.","hearthstone","0"
"775","It just sucks lmao. No matter how you build it it will never be a good deck. The best thing you can make of it is a temu version of hero power druid. 

Best case scenario is you get 5 hero powers in a turn. And then what ? 10 added damage total won't kill anyone. Druid does the same thing pressing hero power once. Cmon now","hearthstone","0"
"776","Not enough info.

The dust you get will be the highest rate from anything you can buy. But buying packs of cards you need is always more value if you don’t have a big collection.","hearthstone","0"

"778","How much dust is that worth? 3200?

So 2400 gold for 2 legendaries … not sure if that’s worth it.

You can buy 24 packs with an average of 100 dust each. But that can always go towards packs that you want legendaries from …","hearthstone","0"

"780","I think Starcraft could've easily been an entire, different expansion. There are a lot of interesting draenei and demon characters, and starships for Warrior, Shaman and Paladin could've been handled more gracefully.
On the other hand, 3 legendary characters to represent Starcraft is just... too little. It is a vast universe with many characters, and if you make a crossover, I think you should do it justice","hearthstone","0"

"783","I don't even see viper that annoying. You have to build zerg cards around it. 

Standalone Viper is 2 times as worse than dirty rat and it has not taunt and mediocre stats for the cost. The rotation is going to hurt zerg DK pretty badly.

"786","It depends, if you're playing the long game it's definitely worth it dust-wise, but we have expansion around the corner and if you want to play new decks as they emerge, 10-20 packs can make a difference, because we have duplicate protection now","hearthstone","0"
"787","What the first guy said, wait till the new expansion, dust, craft a strong cheap deck when the meta settles.

If you want to climb right now, however, I would recommend what I've personally have had a lot of success with: weapon or archon rogue and elemental mage. I've climbed using a lot of other decks but the ones I mentioned are all really cheap, fast paced, and easy to pilot.

Weapon rogue you legit just mulligan for quick pick, draw a pirate, or your weaponsmith and go face, archon plays a bit more like a combo/big minion rogue where you play for board control and then play opportunistically with your archon and charge cards, and elemental mage plays like a standard midrange typa deck where you curve out and have a ton of different wincons.

Another time was I had been in weapons working and a noisemaker kill popped up in shields. Someone accused me of vanishing in storage and ""running past the body"" to end up in weapons and a few other people were backing me up saying there must have been a glitch or something (SS was not in the game) but I still got voted out by 1 vote more than someone else who was more sus than I was (4 to 3)","among-us","0"

"799","Not sure if this is related.

But i know, without a doubt. That if a host leaves.  The person to become the next host is the first person to enter into the lobby after a game has ended.

To elaborate.   The person who clicks ""play again"" the fastest, and gets either the first seat on the left side of the ship (or the 2nd if the host clicks faster than you due to host connection advantage)  THAT person becomes host.

  
I am often very fast with clicking ""play again"" and usually get the first seat to the left.   Everytime a host has left.   I consistently became the host.","among-us","0"
"800","Great question. I’m not sure on this but another alternative.. if your friend is hosting and can wait, then we always “host swap” in lobby. Meaning everyone copies code and comes back in 2 min while the host and new host stay and swap.","among-us","0"
"801","The host becomes whoever joined the lobby second. I don’t think it’s related to whoever kicked the old host first because I was in a lobby once where they kicked the host out and I became host but I didn’t vote kick the old host. You probably just join the lobby again first.","among-us","0"

He just walks around like nothing happened, so either everyone was teaming or just dumb, this kid also couldn’t spell simple words like black correctly so im guessing he was actually 6 years old.

He also said something like “i win this now” so im guessing he thought that the imposters weren’t teammates and had to kill eachother? This was a while ago so i dont remember everything but he did start waffling about some more stupud stuff in chat","among-us","0"

Also I’d like to add that despite popular belief, i’m almost CERTAIN that they updated the game and now were able to level up. I play everyday, doesn’t matter what lobby i’m in. I gain XP for my levels after every game I play, and I know damn well not every lobby is glitched lmfaoooooo.

"814","I feel like there would be a lot less trash settings if Innersloth had thought about how the settings work more.

I think it should be done a connected scaling basis, instead of completely customisable.

So for example; if the host increases the imps kill cd, then the amount of tasks should increase accordingly - then you'd never have 3 tasks with 45 seconds kill cool down sort of games.

Imp vision should always be at least 0.25x better than crew, so the more crew vision gets increased then Imp vision will always increase along with it (but always only at least 0.25 - so if crew vision is 1.0 and Imp vision is 2.5, the Imp vision wouldn't start scaling until crew vision was increased to 2.25 if that makes sense)

If player speed is reduced, then the kill distance should go to short, and then increase the speed it should go to long

You get the idea, connect some of these settings instead of having them all be independent of eachother and fully customisable


Also have you guys ever seen how trash the ""recommended settings"" (called ""core settings"" now since the menu updates) are?

45 seconds kill cd, 4 tasks, player speed x1.0, kill distance medium, 15 seconds discuss with 120 seconds voting?
That's seriously the settings they recommend as good ""balanced"" settings.","among-us","0"

"816","In all fairness most of the settings in public lobbies are very bad. Especially if you ever search for “expert” lobbies - best luck is to sort it by both casual and serious

"823","It’s because the annoying teenagers that were rife during the games peak have all grown up to be the self proclaimed “experts” on how the game the should be played. 

They treat public lobbies like a private discord and have watched streamers that play with their friends all the time. 

If you play regularly with a group you know who self reports regularly and who doesn’t, in a public lobby you don’t know and sometimes self reporting makes the most sense. 

I lost my partner round 1 in a game and managed to get it down to 4, me and one other were “sus” so I waited until we split up, killed the clear one in front of the other sus crew and self reported. 

The reaction to me doing this was insane, the guy I was framing started saying even if you win you’re disgusting etc. and then when back in lobby the host was pondering whether to ban me for such awful behaviour.

"824","I understand being afraid of stack kills, because a good lobby will remember who was in the stack and sus them and partially clear everyone else, if your teammate is dumb enough to do a double stack kill then everyone knows that both imposters were in the stack and everyone out of it is hard cleared

All I replied was “yep, and I’m not gonna say sorry if killing you = a win for me.” 
“You shouldn’t be afk anyways for the final six with 2 impostors left anyway so”

"829","Multi-faceted issue.

At it's base is the fact that this game is very slow to introduce new elements (maps, roles, cosmetics, etc), so naturally, people are going to get bored and want to modify the way it's played. It's been so for years, from the first (IMHO, better) unofficial hide-and-seek lobbies to actual modded lobbies (TOH, Deathrun, Speedrun, etc). So that's one cause for people making rules.

The ""no voting til 6"" rule isn't one I've heard. Sort of seems like the host wants longer games, where crew don't get voted out for stupid reasons (venting when there are engies, ""X is following me"", etc). But if the host has full lobbies and players who stay, SOMEONE must like it. I don't think I would be one of those people, so you know what I would do?

I'd just find another lobby. If there is a lobby with rules you don't like, don't be a petulant child (""Become ungovernable"", as one responder said) and break the rules because you don't like them, or whine about the rules. Just fucking leave. If you REALLY think you voice is SO important that the host needs to know why you are leaving, do so politely (""Oh, those rules don't look like they're for me, but have fun!"", then out). You aren't going to change anyone's mind by acting like a twat and breaking the rules, or just calling them stupid.

Apart from all that, AFK players, and the rules made to protect them, frustrate me as well. If the game were so important that they HAD to stay in the lobby, regardless of whether they are doing anything, copy the lobby code before you go AFK, or as soon as you ENTER a lobby, and LEAVE if you know you are going to be AFK. I don't host, but if I didn't, AFK players would not be protected and would be booted after two or three consecutive rounds of being AFK. They are a drag on the game regardless of whether they are imp or crew, and whether they have been killed to not (dead AFK crew STILL don't do tasks)","among-us","0"

If playing in a two impostor game with two engineers and it's 10+ people in the game, 50/50 is a perfectly acceptable bet. Don't vote it on 7 with two imps or 4 with one, but other than that, absolutely vote it. I'm sorry but I don't believe you are correct on hating this one.

2. These people are trolls. Ban them from your lobbies. 100% with you on that one.

3. That's the risk of pugging a lobby. Sometimes you just get a bad batch. Resetting and starting a new one has yielded the best results for me.

4. Silent play crew mate is half an impostor. Ban them from your lobby. Silent play impostor might be an attempt to stay unnoticed, especially if the lobby is of questionable quality. See if they are quiet when not impostor.

5. Random vote outs shouldn't be happening. Reset and make a new lobby if this occurs more than a couple times.

6. Inappropriate names, report and ban in that order. Don't start the game until this is done.

7. Bad chat = ban. Simple as that.

8. Start = ban unless the lobby is truly full and the host seems to be unaware (especially if they are actively talking). ""Start please"" in this case earns respect.","among-us","0"

"851","There are hosts who cheat.  They download modded or hacks, there are even hacks for Android now.

I've been watching a group I play with.  There are 3 who downloaded mods.  We just kicked out a long time regular for proven hacking, and have a list of hackers.  We're not allowing another player into our lobbies who knowingly associates with other highly damaging or cheat hackers.

Those who host, can either have mods or hacks engaged even in a lobby that doesn't load them.  They (depending) can see the roles of all players, maybe see the entire map at once.

Many will act like victims of being killed first, complaining.  This for me is a red flag of a cheater.  The reason is, they follow the imps so they can witness the kill, mistime moving away when cool down runs out.

To follow the rule don't kill host round 1 is either going to drag out the game, or the imp has to kill with host magically right there to witness.  Or, knowledge impossible for them to have regarding the imp and kill.

So, in my group, our current modded host is obviously cheating in this method, by following the imp r1, with the rule don't kill host r1.  I just kill them. I lack any patience for cheaters like this.  It ruins the game. They aren't brave enough to ban me, because I can fill their lobbies.  Since I ignore the rule, so do others.

The host has already been called out by me over instantly knowing who the imps are r1/r2.  They've adjusted their tactics.

I've begun inviting modded hosts with different mods.  It's how I caught the last cheater.  I avoid directly accusing without proof from modded screenshots.

So, why would someone ban you? Many reasons.  None likely legitimate. Political, the color you have, being a better player, looking like someone else's character, and variations of cheating, being wrongfully blamed or accused.

Emotionally immature hosts, bullies, cheaters.  Those are the ones who do it.

I have a good reputation.  I can see when hackers drop code because I use developer's tools that allow me to look at the code at certain points.  I don't play with hacks or mods myself, but have tested mods.  I have zero desire to play a game cheating or with hard to resist exposure to information that gives me an unfair advantage.

It's like sitting down to a game of Scrabble.  All the other players only see their letters.  But this one player can see everyone's letters, and unscramble options for every combination each turn, but thinks they're not cheating somehow.","among-us","0"

"854","Tbh this is probably the most well-structured one of these I’ve seen.

Last Impostor: Love it, interesting idea, there are some specific roles for this in mods, like the Underdog.

Flashlight Mode: I would make it so that there are no flashlights with lights on and they only turn on with lights off, they would be a separate setting like vision where you could dictate their range.

X-ray Vision: Instead of making it a separate setting I would just make it so that when you clicked past the 5.0x vision it would be the next thing

Filter Changes: I don’t agree with this. The sabo cooldown idea is great, but I wouldn’t want to change the filters to restrict certain types of game play. Maybe you can just break up the various things you put into extreme mode into separate in-lobby settings that can be enabled.

Wall Change: From what I’ve heard Inner Sloth has already said that being able to see phantom/ss animations through walls is an intended feature of the game (which is really dumb, I get not wanting to have people go into corners and have half the animation not visible, but just make the game push them away from a wall so that the animation becomes more visible instead.)

Snatcher: The same as the Doppelgänger role in TOHE, so that is cool, mimicking the style of speech and play of other players can be difficult, but lots of fun. In TOHE it is a neutral killer, but I can imagine it being an impostor role just as well.

Detector: I like this a lot, not too OP (telling you who impostor is) just letting you know they are there.

I never played with them ever again, I literally left their discord server","among-us","0"

The hackers either do it for goodies, to cheat and win, or to ruin lobbies. Most hackers simply ruin game play for selfish reasons.

"897","Hey, someone who got banned here!

I was permabanned for toxic behavior and  was told the decision would not be reversed, but actually was reversed.

You should appeal to innersloth through their site:

1. Go to their website

2. at the bottom of the page, there is a link with Help & FAQ section, click it.

3. next you should see accounts & Billing, click on that. at the very top of that page, there is a section about           being banned, click that.

4. After you've been redirected to that page, go to the very bottom of the page where it says to dispute a permanent ban, that should redirect you to the appeal section.

Now, as for the actual appealing, here's what I did to get unbanned:

I expressed remorse for my actions, I did not make any sob stories or give excuses, just telling them that I goofed up, said that I understand that my actions negatively impacted the players and the game and that I'd never do it again.

My first appeal was denied, I was told the decision was final, I thought that was it, still I felt that while I was an asshole, I wasn't an asshole to a degree, it warranted an instant permaban, so I applied a month later.

I went through the same song and dance, expressing regret and I was back in the game.

(All of this was done through email, when they didn't have an appeal system)

After I got unbanned, I don't even swear in game anymore, because I do believe that the innersloth crew was being gracious with me, even if I most likely got spam reported on racism and hacking, but I'm still not risking it with even mildy bad behavior.

  
After the appeal process, all you can do is hope that your appeal is accepted.

Best of luck appealing your case, I'm rooting for you!","among-us","0"
"898","Hmm, I would say probably not. The large majority of players are either children or adults who play among us as a hobby/break from their everyday life.

"901","This idea would never have worked but if it ever would have you're like 5 years too late.  

The player base has largely left this game and most of the remaining players are casuals.  Plus, in a game like Among Us, nobody knows how good you are because there's no competitive scene.  There are very few streamers left and no built-in SBMM.  You can say you're a really good player but there's no way to actually prove it unlike, for example, someone who has large tournament wins under their belt in an FPS or MMO or something.

That being said, I really appreciate the vision comparisons you did on your website.","among-us","0"
"902","I assume this is a joke post but if it's not I don't know who enjoys a game like this or how.  I would rather play a different game than a game with these settings.

"904","Other day I was playing in a lobby where the host was the imposter. I immediately caught her first round in, everyone ignored it when I said they killed LOL. Next round, she follows me and kills me of course. She slid under the radar up until the very last round because everyone else was clear or accounted for, so she gets voted out. We’re waiting for the next game to start and she bans the people who caught her as imp, claims they cheated (as if I didn’t out her immediately in round 1) then she proceeds to start having a power trip in chat with someone else. Next game starts, I tell chat to kick her for misconduct, they do LOL. Tell me why this person who was in the previous game having a power trip with her starts insulting me.
Game ends, we get back into the lobby, guess who comes back? Old host. 

SHE WAS TEAMING THE ENTIRE TIME😭😭😭😭

"905","I've gotten my accusers voted off when they've caught me by calling them a snitch and making a (very quick) case.  Makes me laugh (and no, I don't do it often, once a month maybe? )  I will usually apologize afterwards and most don't blame me, they blame crew at that point.","among-us","0"
"906","As others are saying, this isn't a subreddit rule. It's a rule on the platform itself regarding witch-hunting. 

Especially if it has the potential of getting to the point where people take being a vigilante too far and try to do things like find who is trolling in a lobby and doxx them publicly, well meaning or not. 

Also especially with people potentially trying to track down others to harass them actively on purpose. Like if I said ""I found a troll with the name xima†r0llx, go harass them"", that would be against terms of service on the platform as a whole and could get the subreddit banned. Similar to the now long defunct r/FindBostonBombers, wrongly identifying people as suspects. 

The people who do post names in good faith, I get it. You mean well and have good intentions (presumably). However, some things, I cannot allow if it has the potential for people to interpret it as something to take serious action on, including harming or harassing someone.

Edit: Also posts that are literally just about someone saying stuff in the chat are considered low effort. Playing Among Us (or really almost any game) and seeing someone be inappropriate or doing something wrong is like going in a forest and seeing trees, both are things that will easily happen, given enough time. Trolls do what they do because it gets them attention. By posting it here, you give them exactly what they want, providing motivation to continue trolling. There's a reason why those posts get taken down.","among-us","0"

On polus, I find it more telling when someone skip keys all together when it is a common task because that usually means they're trying to get into position to kill or ss. But I still won't vote people out because of it. It's a good way to get a feel of who is so early","among-us","0"

"916","Well, in a competent lobby the imposter would sab comms to make it essentially useless to check people like that.

I can clear at most maybe 5 people with it, of course I also have an error margin, so I sometimes mess up badly, if there's a cluster of people on the task.

I'd say it's a semi-reliable strat, if the impostor forgets that comm sab is a thing.","among-us","0"

-super uneven tasks to kill cooldown. or even not enough tasks. if there’s only 2-3, i’m out.

if there’s 4 tasks and the kill cooldown is 45 seconds, im out. imps stand no chance.

-super low imp vision. again, imps stand no chance.

-speed. I prefer 1.5-1.75, but will play in lobbies anywhere from 1.25-2.0. anything outside of that range and i’m not doing it","among-us","0"
"923","i sometimes am, especially with the following settings:

player speed: i prefer 1.5. will play on 1.25 or 1.75, MAYBE 2.0 but still usually not.

roles: genuinely seen so many games with 56 engineers, 413 scientists, 1092 phantoms, like dude, you only need TWO. two of each crew role, one of each imp role.

tasks: i REFUSE to play on a lobby with ~4 tasks. especially with high kill cd.

visual, anonymous and confirm ejects: off, on, off. i have NEVER understood confirm ejects off. you're just handicapping yourself by what i call ""vote and pray"". if someone's sus? vote and pray. are they imp? did we sacrifice a crewmate on 6? who knows. also, visual tasks makes the game absolutely trivial. like, pink, maroon, black, yellow, blue and black did scan, orange and red did asteroids, and rose, banana, lime and cyan did [miscellaneous hard clear task]. that only leaves green, purple and white! guess they're the 3 imposters!

"928","I'd say these are fairly normal ""serious"" difficulty settings. I recommend dropping imp vision to at least 3x. Depending on the device, 5x vision can cause the game to get a little laggy. Most likely to have a straight horizontal line or two through the middle of the screen. You don't need a high vision to see the entirety of your surroundings on the majority of maps. 

Your settings do check my biggest pet peeve in this game, though. No lobby should ever have more than two difficulties selected, imo. When searching for lobbies, the only difficulty I have selected is expert. I'm not looking to play in casual or beginner lobbies due to experience gaps. 

My personal vision of an expert lobby has anon votes, confirm ejects off, no roles at easily predictable percentages, two of each impostor roles. Unpredictable settings create  challenges for both imps and crew. I don't expect this from random lobbies, but it would be great as a seasoned player to have the opportunity more often. 

I'd only stay in your lobby if the people were enjoyable to play with due to the four lobby filters.

I was accused by 2 people, and despite myself and others pointing out that Mixup was on so it clearly wasn't me, they wouldn't listen. I did not get voted until the next round when one of my accusers said it was me again when I'd caught someone killing

Despite people claiming my innocence, I was still voted (it was a close vote but still) and I confront one of my accusers in dead chat who tries to lie their way out of it and claim ""I didn't know mixup was on"". To which I point out that that's bullshit because multiple people told them it was and that I was innocent. So they did know, they just didn't listen.

"939","You said settings snobs welcome - here I am! 

Things I like: 

\- Task Bar Updates: Meetings - Thank god.

\- Kill Cooldown: 17.5s - With 2 imps and 15 players, this is decent.

\- Player Speed: 1.5 - Perfect.

\- Emergency Cooldown: 30s - For a lobby with randoms, it's nice that this is very high above the kill cooldown.

\- Tasks: Task settings seem chill.

\_\_\_\_

Things that I don't like and would cause me to leave instantly:

\- Guardian Angel: 8 - Any more than 1 is just an awful time for everyone. Why? It makes games drag on sooo long and robs good impostor players (not me lol, I suck at imp) of deserved wins. Honestly even 1 is pushing it.

\- Noisemaker: 6 - Any more than 1 is just an awful time for everyone. Why? People get cleared for free without even doing anything clever or needing vitals - makes scientist entirely irrelevant, punishes imps for what would otherwise have been clean kills, and makes hiding bodies impossible. Honestly even 1 is pushing it. 

\_\_\_\_

Things I don't like but am willing to live with:

\- Emergency Meetings: 3 - I prefer this at 1, since then people can't spam buttons, and impostors can be clever about who they kill to prevent buttons from being called.

\- Crewmate Vision: 1.25x - I prefer \*max\* 1.0x, as 1.25 you can still see wayyyy too much even when lights are off.

\- Discussion/Voting time: 30s - I prefer longer discussions/voting, so that there's actually time to debate and share information past ""I saw X kill"" ""No u""

\- Visual Tasks: On - I prefer off. Just a boring way to get cleared...","among-us","0"
"940","I won't comment on the things that I subjectively don't like, but objectively (more or less) as someone with 700h in the game:

* If I see crew vision above 1.0x, I immediately know that it's most likely a beginner host
* 60s total meeting time is not enough for meaningful discussion usually. Enough for random voting though.
* Visual tasks on = noob setting, sorry. Clearing each other by looking at visual tasks is easy level and takes no brain or skill. Good for beginners maybe.
* Way too many roles. 1 tracker is already super strong, 2 is overkill. 8 guardian angels is just senseless, as they can completely disable imp action late game.

Generally these settings favor crew too much.","among-us","0"

Kill cooldown is too long for a tiny map like skeld
Way too many noisemakers

Visuals on is going to clear most of the crew by round two
Way too many angels you're essentially raising the kill cooldown from 17.5 to 27.5 because they will constantly be blocked","among-us","0"

"955","Depends on your lobby.  Usually, yes.  The problem isn't the roles though, it's the players.  The game is pretty boring if you're not playing with engaged people (the majority of public lobby players).

If I get vanilla crewmate and I head left on Skeld and I do my vials task and then start going to reactor but a meeting gets called, well I haven't really done anything with my 30 seconds.  My contribution to the meeting, where all the actual fun in this game is to be had, will simply be ""I went left"" (and maybe I saw a person which, while helpful, may or may not actually matter).  If there's one guy saying ""it's red.  trust"" and nobody else says anything then, well, I'm not really having a great time.  As long as I didn't see red go left with me then I'm just kinda voting randomly.  Feels bad man.

The roles simply give players something to do if they get stuck as crewmate in a lame public lobby game.  Sure, I went left and have no helpful information, but at least I know the time of death because I was scientist.  Or I could vent to electrical because I'm engineer.  It's not much but the quality of these games lives and dies with the meetings currently, and roles are a way to spice up the out-of-meeting experience at least a little bit.

The social deduction and hidden roles game NEEDS social deduction around the hidden roles because there is little to no game here to hold the experience up if nobody is talking during a meeting.

Also, the default settings for a lot of roles are TERRIBLE which means players may have one or two experiences with a role/the roles and go ""this sucks, I'm turning them off"" and then their mind is made up.","among-us","0"

"971","This has been a thorn in my side the last two days.

So first off if they're camping cams, imo, that's the most beginner thing you can do, selfing at that point is nothing. It feels to me anymore that people complain about selfing only do it because they can't catch the imp and they need an excuse. Selfing is part of the game, learn how to find the imp. I'm not claiming to be the best at the game I'm probably not even mediocre but I never am mad cuz the impostor selfed. 

Sometimes it feels like ""expert lobby"" rules only exist so that crewmates win.","among-us","0"

"973","Tbh no your not wrong. Most of the expert groups i play with allow selfing as long as it is being used reasonably. 
Those rules are meant to make the game fun. As long as people are being respectful usually most people don't care if you self occasionally when it makes logical sense to, or dance with another crewmate in admin for a few seconds. ","among-us","0"
"974","God how I hate the no selfing rule lobbies. It's not a part of the game. If it were ever supposed to be an actual rule, there would be an option to turn off the report button for imposters. I get not wanting people to camp cams, but the countermeasure to that should be calling comms sabbo, which people very rarely seem to utilize. And the same lobbies ban for killing AFK players too. Seriously, if you have to play with a bunch of self imposed rules that make the game basically unbalanced for imps to even have a chance, GTFO of so called ""expert"" lobbies.","among-us","0"

"979","Grouping is so lame, because it makes the game last forever and ruins the whole ""who did it"" aspect. That's why usually if a lobby has rules, it has a no grouping rule.  
Imo it would be great if there was a sabotage teleporting everyone on a vent or something like that. It would be a one time use thing for balance reasons obviously.","among-us","0"
"980","i think that grouping is super lame. at ANY point in the game, but especially when it's the final 4. it's unfair to the imposter(s), and it would be such a cheap win. i'm a believer in among us being a brain game. you have to use your brain, and it isn't always supposed to be easy. by grouping up, you make it easy on yourself. and that is just SO lame. it's also something's that teamers do. if a teamer would do it, it is lame as fuuuuuuuck.","among-us","0"

"997","You mentioned getting kicked for finding out the imps, for that one I’m obviously on your side, so dumb when people kick you for completing your objective as a crewmate.

Did you just say it in a single message? Or did you spend multiple messages talking about your pizza in a meeting? Those affect the situation.

"1000","Those people telling you otherwise are wrong. By definition a self report is reporting your own kill. Reporting your fellow imps kill is something else entirely. Sometimes you HAVE to report their kills to avoid being seen just leaving the body. Thats not the same as killing and reporting on yourSELF just to act like you stumbled upon a body. In one case the imp is actually reporting on themselves, while the other the imp is actually just coming upon a body and doing what any crew would do. Given that that’s the whole point of being imp- pretend to be crew while killing- calling it a self report is just stupid.","among-us","0"
"1001","I usually see it as an imposter reporting their kills just right when they do it or after.

I don't really consider it a self-report if an imposter reports their own kill if they found it with a crewmate or made a lap around the map and nobody has found it yet.","among-us","0"
"1002","That’s not what a self report is. These are just kids who know u were also the imposter and wanted to get u out as well and probably didn’t know who ur partner was. This is all most as bad as when someone thinks ur the imposter cause the task bar didn’t go up.","among-us","0"

"1004","That's not a self report. If you're going to lose if you don't report your partner's kill, because you're going to be seen walking away from it, report it.

"1005","Jump in and learn the maps. Memorize the room names first. You can open your map any time including in meetings

You can try hide and seek as a way to learn them too. And no meetings every 5 seconds","among-us","0"
"1006","Learn the rooms for every map. If you don't know where you are use your map it will show you. Also turn color blind text on. Even if you aren't color blind it's very useful to help learn the colors so you're not accidentally getting pink voted out when you meant rose. It also helps when an outfit hides the color of the crewmate. Also learn which tasks are visual and can get you cleared. If visuals are off you still see your visuals but not anyone elses, and they can't see yours. Vent clean can be used to clear you if there's engineers enabled (it disables the vent and pulls them out). Also common tasks are tasks that either everyone has or no one has. So if the host has only 1 common task on Skeld, you can see if an impostor fakes the wrong common task (if you want I can tell you which tasks are visual/common but this comment is long enough)","among-us","0"
"1007","Visuals are tasks that other people can watch you do and you can be cleared by them. Trash, asteroids, med scan, and shields are all visuals on Skeld, and Skeld is the most commonly played map. Visuals can be turned off by the host, however it’s not very common, and you can also check the settings of the lobby you join before the game starts, it will tell you if visuals are on or off.

Engineer wasn’t always a role on the game, so a lot of people think that venting is automatically sus - it’s not. Hosts can choose to make everyone an engineer if they wanted to (obv besides imp), so that’s just something to keep in mind. I like to check the settings before the game starts to make note of how many engineers there are, if any. As an imp, I suggest not killing near vents if there’s engineers. If you do choose to kill near vents, sabotage comms first. Sabotaging comms prevents people from being able to enter the vents, imposter is excluded from that prevention. 
Sabotaging comms also temporarily disables cameras until the sabotage is fixed. 

If you’re an engineer and you’re hiding in the vents, people can clean you out of the vent if they have the ‘clean vent’ task, this clears them. 
If you have the vent cleaning task but you have no visuals and there are engineers in your game, you can ask an engineer to vent in the room that you have the task in, and you can clean them out of the vent to prove that you’re clear by tasking. 

There are cameras around the map in the security hallway, medbay to upper engine hallway, o2 to navigation hallway, and the admin to storage hallway. There are little lights on the cameras that blink red when somebody is actively in security on cams. If nobody is on cams, there is no blinking light on the cameras. 

Hosts CAN be kicked from their own lobbies, just a forewarning in case this ever happens to you lmfao.

This is all I have right now lol.","among-us","0"
"1008","People say ""check the settings"" but don't say what settings to check when joining a lobby. Here's my quick list:

0) Check the list of roles - make sure you know what roles are on, so that you don't end up hard accusing someone of being evil since they vented but they turn out to be Engineer, and that you don't end up tunnelling on someone for killing in front of you only to turn out there was a Shapeshifter, etc.

1) ""Visual Tasks"" On/Off: Some tasks can be seen by other players if this setting is on. This means that if someone sees you doing this task, they can hard clear you, or if someone sees you faking it, they can call you out.

In Skeld, visual tasks include: Trash chute (storage room, you pull down a lever, the visual will be below that on the outer wall of the ship), Shields (shields room, you click hexagonal panels, the visual is the lights outside the ship getting brighter), Asteroids/Weapons (weapons room, you shoot some asteroids on a screen, the visual is outside the ship with the guns shooting), and Med Scan (medbay room, you get scanned, the visual is you getting scanned). In Polus, there is also Med Scan and Weapons, they are just in different rooms. These are the two most common maps.

Note: good players will be able to tell if you are faking med scan even with visual tasks off, due to the animation of the player walking on to the scanner. Better players will be able to fake this ""walk"".

2) ""Taskbar Updates"": The taskbar shows in the top left. The setting set to ""Always"" means that the moment a crewmate finishes a task, the taskbar will move. If you fake a task as an impostor, make sure to not get caught by someone seeing you ""finish"" the task without the taskbar moving. (The other possible settings don't require you do this)

3) ""Anonymous Votes"": If you vote someone, does it tell everyone that \*you\* did (Off)? Or just that someone did (On)? Make sure you aren't voting in an obviously evil way if everyone can tell if you were the one voting.

4) ""Crewmate Vision"": 1.0x and lower means that calling lights can actually help you quite a bit as impostor, as crew vision will be pretty small if lights are off. Higher than 1.0x lights are less useful, as crew can still see a lot even when they're ""off"".","among-us","0"

"1014","Engineers is good for more than venting for speed and spying; if someone has a vent clean task, an engineer can hop into the vent and when the crewmate cleans it the eng pops out, accompanied by a loud warped-metal noise.

Everyone that downloaded and played the game but stopped before that update won't have the achievement.  By late 2021 most of the covid players had quit so I'm honestly surprised the number isn't lower tbh.  I have it on my PC but I won't have it on my phone, for example.

Plus since I'm the pace setter, I can play at whatever pace I want. Nothing I hate more than wanting to play aggressive, but getting stuck with a tank player that's super defensive. In my experience your supports want to heal you, so so long as you aren't literally just jumping into the backline and breaking LOS, they'll often go with whatever pace you are setting.

I don't know where people got this idea from. At no point have the developers said that it's the point of the whole game, and every active stance they've taken on the matter suggests that they *don't want* people to feel compelled to swap.

So if the developers don't want players to feel like they have to swap, and most of the players don't want to feel like they have to swap, why are there some few players who so confidently insist that *having to counterswap is the whole point of the game*?

As a more direct answer to your question, play tank. Probably 90% of the complaints about counterswapping are about tanking, because that's what the current meta/roster is demanding from players.","overwatch","0"

In Comp sure do whatever it takes to win, in QP I only mirror cuz that’s fair imo, but even then when I start mirroring Zarya= insta Rein.

"1102","Honestly I see toxic people in qp more often. Comp is mostly silence then sudden complaints before or right after loss. It’s like they suddenly care.

"1103","It might help a little with reducing toxicity but with the way the endorsement system currently works having a required amount for comp is fairly pointless, because all you have to do is play something like deathmatch and not type anything and you'll probably get several endorsements a match especially during low server population times. And you'll get even more endorsements in such games by respecting the ""friendly"" players, which amusingly might end up teaching people to be less toxic in general.","overwatch","0"

"1128","i've discussed this before, but i'm a tank main that started in ow2 (s9) and i love this role. i don't even mind if my team's not great. is it frustrating to lose a winnable game? sure, but i've had my off days, so i'm sure other people who are more caught up in wins and losses probably have them more often. it happens, but next time i'll be the one facing a tank with a bad team. 

i also play with voice and chat off. would it be more fun if i was in team, yeah, but i've found the ping system is more than sufficient for the majority of games. i play both solo and stack, and my stack are actually randoms i added after good games and became friends with. ymmv but i just don't find the other roles as much fun. support is second to me and then dps, just because i like the team aspect of the game more than making solo plays. 

it probably annoys me more when i mention maining tank and get a bunch of pity or sympathy. ""masochist"" or ""you just haven't played 6v6"" i did play 6v6, oq and rq, and i didn't like it nearly as much as 5v5. there's even more luck factoring in when my role gets split, as opposed to knowing that i can do what i do better than the enemy tank.

"1155","Siege is a slower game that uses slower pacing and faster time to kill as its lens for strategy. The gunplay isn’t inherently easy, but the slow pace of the game means you can *choose* to play in a way that minimizes your dependency on mechanics, and in a way that will decrease the level of variance involved in your strategy. You have very few times you have to think on your toes if you prepare adequately for, or even outright deny, the enemy team’s options.

In Overwatch, there’s still strategy, but the hard gunplay will seek you out. You can’t simply choose to push slower, quieter, or with more utility to clear corners; you need to be able to juggle your strategy *and* carry out difficult mechanical fights at the same time. The pace of gameplay being so much higher means you can’t always predict every outcome, and you’ll need to be able to deal with parts of your strategy falling apart and think quickly enough to deal with it as well as possible.

It’s really just because it’s a different game. Siege is a *tactical* shooter, so it’s always going to be slower—and that lends itself well to being able to separate strategy and gunplay. You don’t have that luxury with Overwatch, and it’s okay for your friend not to like Overwatch for that reason! The game isn’t for everyone.","overwatch","0"

"1157","I had this conversation with a friend who plays league, and tried OW. 

It doesn't have strategy like Seige. The strategies are completely different considering one is a tactical first person shooter and the other is a competitive team-based shooter with wildly different abilities and pacings. In Seige you don't have to worry about a Junkrat taking you out from the top ropes with an explosive. You just need to point and shoot, be the last person standing/secure your objectives. And the person with the more skill generally wins. 

Overwatch requires knowledge on every character and their ability. It requires being able to scan high and low ground, make sense of audio cues, hit shots, out play your enemy, utilizing the utility in kits, etc. The game is nothing but strategy unless you are quite literally running it down mid dying over and over again. And I think OW offers an amazing skill ceiling for all types of players, which you can't really find in games nowadays. Normally it's simply who has the best aim/reflexes. Not with OW.","overwatch","0"

"1187","Leading up to OW1's launch it was mostly just cause it was the hot new game that all my friends were hyped for.  I'd never played any other Blizzard games at the time (Or TF2, which was obviously the biggest comparison it had), but Overwatch had fantastic character/map designs that clearly appealed to more than just Blizzard fans, so I tried the beta and fell in love with it.

Nowadays, I still play it because it's one of the few big multiplayer games that doesn't feel like it's weighed down by a bunch of unnecessary garbage.  There isn't a bunch of extra shit tacked on taking away from the core of the game (Which is one of the reasons I stopped playing Fortnite and CoD), collaborations feel like they're actually curated for the game and not just thrown in at random, etc.

People clowned on OW2 for barely being a sequel, but I'm kind of *glad* they didn't go too far with it.  Sure the way PvE turned out is disappointing, but on the multiplayer side of things, I'm glad it still mostly feels the same as it did in OW1.

They roll rarity first then check for dupes after and then give you a different item within that rarity. Having more items doesn't make it more likely to get a legendary for example. Still useful to spend credits on items just to clear it out so things that can only be bought with coins are left.

"1210","I think a good balance would be your have to have +1 more person on your team on the point to capture it.

So red has 1, blue must have 2. But the balance part would be it would only count as 1 person towards speed for blue. So if you wanted full speed of capture, you would need to have 4 people more than the enemy team. 

And the way to make it more competitive, the final capture point is immune to this rule. So anyone can stop it, which would make clutch comebacks still viable.

Instead piledrive could function on the ground to spin in place for a second (with maugas charge properties) and get fireball speed into one direction.

"1232","I main a few heroes so here I go:


**Lifeweaver**
------------
**Cleansing Grasp:**

In addition to the cleanse, it also adds a 50 health heal over time if you cleanse something.

*Reasoning:*

This perk is only useful if the enemy team has anti-heal, otherwise it's not really that useful. Adding a conditional buff for it would be nice, because Life Cycle is 100% a better choice that allows you to be more aggressive with your positioning.


**Lifeweaving:**

Your primary heal now also bounces to an ally near your target, healing them for 50% of the heal you hit on the main target.

*Reasoning:*

Original lifeweaving gives Lifeweaver **more** healing which he doesn't need; this perk would alleviate his weakness with healing multiple targets; right now it's competing with a perk that alleviates his lack of damage. Superbloom also synergizes with Life Cycle, which makes it the obvious choice.


**Sombra**
-----------
**~~Viral Efficacy:~~ Worm:**
If an enemy under the effects of a virus dies, they will shoot a virus projectile towards the nearest enemy target.

*Reasoning:*

I personally haven't found much use for this perk other than that it also procs on player owned objects like turrets and such. I feel like a spreading virus is also more aligned with her ability and hero fantasy.


**White hat:**

Heals for 100 + 20% of the allies' max health for 2 seconds. Hacking on an allied target cannot be cancelled by damage.

*Reasoning:*

I find this perk fun just for the hero fantasy alone. I just think that it needs a bit of oomph to be powerful enough to be taken.


**Stack Overflow:**

Virus will apply hack's effect onto the target it hits.

*Reasoning:*

I know this sounds crazy, but hear me out: This will give you the double amount of silence if you hack a target normally, wait for a second and then throw your virus on the target. 

On the flip-side if you hit a target with a virus: You cannot hack them with your normal hack anymore. This forces you to consider your options and play differently which I think is a really good thing about the perks. Also this would alleviate Sombra players not picking either one of their major perks sometimes.


**Symmetra**
----------------
**Advanced Teleportation:**

Teleporter’s range is increased by 50%. Increases the interaction range by 100%.

*Reasoning:*

The perk is already really silly, because the teleporter reaches further than a lot of the sight lines in the game. Being able to interact with the teleporter from further away also encourages you and your teammates to use it more.


**~~Shield Battery:~~ Shield Generator**

Symmetra can now choose between using her teleporter or placing down a shield generator. It gives 50 shield health to allies in a 20 meter radius of the shield generator.

The shield generator lasts forever until it's destroyed by Symmetra pressing her Ability 2 button again or it being destroyed.

*Reasoning:*

Hero fantasy perks are fun and it would also give Symmetra something from her past to play with. Similarly to the White Hat perk, it would be fun to see DPS characters with supportive options in form of perks!","overwatch","0"
"1233","Ball: activating adaptive shields cleanses negative effects.

"1235","My ideas of some strong perks for Zen:

•	⁠critical hits now pierce

•	⁠critical hits refund ammo

•	⁠(agree with u/HFLoki) self-harmony, or while harmony is not actively on a target, Zen gains the harmony orb effect at 50% effectiveness

•	⁠damage Zen deals to non-discorded targets is replicated to discorded target or a portion thereof

•	⁠Orbs of destruction now deal 13 increased damage each, but discord no longer amplifies damage

•	⁠Revert discord to OW1 form (3s no lockout)

•	⁠Each successive orb you successfully hit a target with increases your fire rate by 5%, stacking up to 5 times. Lasts for two seconds after you miss a shot and start back at 0%.

•	⁠Landing a critical shot applies the discord effect to the target for two seconds

•	⁠When discord is removed or the target dies, explode for the amplified damage discord did while active

•	⁠10 more ammo

•	⁠Volley is silent

•	⁠Headshots on discorded target slow them by 20% for 1 second

•	⁠Harmony orb surges with power when Zenyatta lands a killing blow, healing allies within 10m of the Harmony Orb target for 50hp.

•	⁠Successful melee attacks restore 2 ammo

•	⁠Kick Dash from April fools patch a few years ago

•	⁠Zen’s orbs ignore tank headshot reductions","overwatch","0"
"1236","So in Overwatch there's a design pattern called favor-the-shooter, it means that in latent (laggy) situations, someone shooting or using an ability has the benefit of being the writer of history as it were. This is why sometimes you get hit after ducking behind cover; from the shooter's POV you were still visible and the game honored that.

So with that in mind, I think Suzu is inherently missing the flag that says it should be considered ""a shooter"". Contrasting Bap's Lantern which will in fact reach back and save teammates through latency, Suzu does not.

The gist of it is to enter an aiming custom game mode (I think the popular one is VAXTA) and follow 4 steps. Set up a timer maybe, 3-5 minutes per step or whatever works for you and get rolling.

Step 1: Hands off the keyboard just track the bots moving around with your eyes only. One a time.

Step 2: Use only the keyboard to mirror the movement of one bot of your choice. Try to follow them with your crosshair without using the mouse at all.

Step 3: Stand still and just track a bot with your mouse only. You can alternate between just tracking and tracking + shooting if you like.

Step 4: Combine all the steps together.

This basically deconstructs the elements that make up great aim and makes sure you put time into your weak spots individually so you don't end up winging your aim forever.","overwatch","0"

"1251","Stop autopiloting and analyze those losses for mistakes. You probably got more and more tilted and played worse and worse.

1. Chill. Rank doesn't matter. Streaks too - games are individual instances, they do not lead to each other. Ignore past results
2. Every 3 losses in a row take a 15 minute breather break. Do something not related to Overwatch.
3. Start gaming session with reviewing last-session's losses. Focus only on yourself (ignore mistakes of teammates even if they objectively 100% lost you game) and only on game-sense and decision making, not mechanics like aiming (unless you spot it's really bad, then you can practice aim separately) so that you can create \*actionable\* points for you to do in next games. For example you spot that you hold your ultimate for too long -> focus on it and force yourself to utilize ult to win fights. Or reverse, where fight is obviously won (like 2-3 easy picks and some ults from teammate were used), but you used your ult anyway for giggles -> focus on tracking who is dead and who used which ult. Maybe get a paper to write those actions and check after game if you did them and reflect if it helped.
4. If 3 is hard at start (e.g. you don't know what to look for, what mistakes are and generally not very analytical) - get coaching for 1-2 sessions and record it. If coach is good, he will ask a lot of questions and try to bring your mistakes through your understanding of the game instead of simply telling you what you did wrong. Simply listening for this worn't help, you need to actively think ""what and why"" so that it sticks.

"1256","Video Game developers, animators and artists talk about this quite abit. It’s a very well known phenomenon in modern media - where there’s a comparatively tiny group of Female face archetypes, especially within a given ethnicity that people in this sphere find attractive. If an artist deviates too heavily, it will get labelled as “ugly”.

You see this effect in full swing with a particularly vocal minority in the gaming audience. You know the ones. The people who think Aloy or Ciri are “too masculine” for having the audacity to have a realistic jaw line, lip shape, or build. There’s a reason *thousands of Anime characters* have *exactly* the same face shape - because that’s what people *expect* for “attractive” characters.

Blizzard, to their credit, have actually pushed the envelope further than many developers - and have been very successful too. Not only do you have a wide range of ethnicities in the cast, but they’ve broadened the physique into areas less tread. Zarya for example with her strong jaw line and rectangular face shape is a massive departure from traditional female faces in video games.

But unfortunately, when it comes to “lithe white woman”, they’re going to struggle for variety. Once you remove the Hair, skin and Eye colour from a female face, the parameters you can safely play with in a video game are minimal, without pushback from the audience. Especially with a stylised art-style like Overwatch.

Right or wrong, it’s just the reality of the situation. So I don’t blame Blizzard for Freyja looking like Widow/Brig. I challenge anyone to make a *truly distinct* face for Freyja that still comes across as “attractive”.","overwatch","0"

"1286","I think the biggest thing about console is having a sens you can actually control. No reason to have a sens that allows you to do 180s of you can't hit your shots consistently. The ""ideal"" sens is probably like 100 100 with 0 aim smoothing but I only know a handful of people who can actually use it and they're all high gm. Even some of the champ dps don't use it cause it's really hard to control + you basically can only flick. 

Some settings to definitely tune/turn off is aim ease in, aim assist ease in, aim assist window size, and aim smoothing. 

Aim ease in messes you up a ton. It's a exponential ramp on your aim which hinders your ability to react to things quickly. I keep this at 0 since I like my sticks actually moving when I want them to. 

Aim assist ease in is also weird. It kind of magnetizes your crosshair onto a person so you can't switch targets easily. I have this at 0 cause you have a hard time switching targets with this on. 

Aim assist window size is in a similar vein to aim assist ease in. Window size by default is probably like half your screen (haven't really tested), but it's the area in which aim assist is going to be active in. If you have it at max it moves even when you aren't aiming at them. I keep it at 15 but you can change it depending on how good your raw aim is. 

Aim smoothing is what the name is and it ""smooths"" your aim. So instead of it going from point A to point B basically immediately, it smooths the process and slows it down as well. If you want very flicky aim you turn this down a bunch. I keep it around 50 which makes it possible to do flicks but also low enough that I can track pretty effectively. I think 70-80 would be better for pure tracking kind of aim. 

Another setting I wanna touch on is the aim techniques, which are dual-zone, exponential, and linear. 
This comes down to preference but I like dual a lot. Let's me have a low sens to track with and a high sens for doing 180s.
Exponential is also pretty good for tracking, but you can't really do instantaneous 180s since it takes a second to ramp up. 
Linear is the ""ideal"" sens since it's basically a 1:1 input to output, but you're stuck with a single sens so you kinda need to choose between tracking and flicking. 

A few other things I wanna touch on

First is controlling your stick. If you're struggling to track you might be pushing the stick all the way too much. You need to be able to use pretty fine movements to aim effectively. If you can't do this, go for a lower sens, higher aim smoothing, with linear. 

Next is practicing your raw aim. Go into training range and to the shooting area. Go for bullseye, 10 or 20m, and stationary with cassidy and any flicking character is guess for flicking practice. And bots, 10m, and player strafe with zarya for tracking. You don't have any aim assist so dial in your settings here. 

After you get it dialed in you kind of need to learn how to play with aim assist. Learning to let it influence your aim while tracking is pretty important. Especially in a close range 1v1 the aim assist should be doing the majority of the aiming. You can practice this in game or things like against bots. 

And probably the most important thing that people don't realize is that movement is half your aim. Whatever movement you take influences your aim as well, so you need to pay attention to it. A lot of people do crazy random movement they don't think about while in a stressful situation and that means you're literally compensating for your random movement while trying to hit them. Especially on console you can go for bigger left to right strafes. Just keep mind of your movement while aiming and it should help a lot. 

Btw if you wanna use my setting as reference:

"1294","This is so much fun.   

Without map/mode context, it's impossible.  A truly horrible composition needs a map/objective context to express its uselessness.

Let's take the rather extreme case of defense on Kings Row: A very tight choke with LOS to the attacker spawn with little open space, on a classic map. 

I'd take Ball, Sombra, Genji, Lucio, Ana  

The team isn't able to exploit the map advantages at all. Nobody can pressure a static position/corner. The tight choke is essentially useless. 

The flankers have no valuable space behind/beside the enemy to operate.  The high and low spawn doors turn everything in front of the choke into a kill zone to poke  heroes without recourse. Sombra has no space to set up attacks. Genji can't engage in front of the choke without being exposed in similar fashion. 

Ball can't swing well off the bus... He'd have to either bait people through the choke into the circus around the statue, which would be a death sentence to Ana, or swing into the space around the bus/enemy spawn off the buildings, accomplishing nothing in relation to the objective, and exposing himself to fire from both spawn doors. He's in an impossible dilemma: wait for an attack on his backline (which is essentially only Ana) or push forward into a hopeless and pointless fight in front of open spawn doors. 

Lucio's choices would be even worse. He has to decide whether or not to support the lonely besieged Ana at the backline, or dive with the flankers into a snake pit of certain death, in front of the spawn doors on the front side of the gate. 

Given how stupid all of that would be, the whole team could then choose to play defensive tactics at the gate choke, but that turns off every advantage the composition holds. They're now playing brawl tactics with heroes that have no abilities or passives that serve that strategy. Hopeless. 

Basically, this is a pure dive comp, in a map situation where dive tactics accomplish nothing but a quick suicide.","overwatch","0"
"1295","A lot of people are bringing up mercy lifeweaver back lines, and while I do agree that those are the two worst supports in the game, I feel like they are not actually the worst duo. You are basically just giving up any sort of offense or utility in favor of raw healing output. This could work for a more static sustain type comp.

I agree with the people saying mercy lucio. The mercy pretty much has to heal bot for the team to have any sustain. Mercy wants to play in safe positions to maximize her uptime, while lucio wants a team that is able to take a fight in his effective heal range to maximize his uptime. To me this represents a fundamental style mismatch that could not be played in any comp.","overwatch","0"

"1297","as for recent comps, supports are the corner stone, so lets start from there.  
zen/mercy/brig/lucio are notorious for low sustain and that can be easily exploited.

i personally say running  
zen mercy should be a really good start.  
now we need a tank that requires high support sustain and very limited mobility, like mauga, orisa, ramatra, roadhog, reinhardt.  
  
 last piece of the puzzle you want a dps that is not good with mercy (not good with pocket, and doesn't synergize with brawl).  
widowmaker/hanzo already have one shots and don't benefit much of the comp, but they are too strong if in high elo hands.  
Symmetra and junkrat seem the least reliable and (inconsistent/requiring set ups).

Hell, I'd argue Bastion does the ""Use the threat of big damage to make space"" motif better since his ability being a delayed transformation followed by a stream of damage makes it more telegraphed and, well, *tank* like compared to Hog's hook being an instant-death button if you can aim.

When playing tanks like Dva against Zarya, you basically have to play avoid her simulator. Get on the backline, get on high ground, Force the Zarya to bubble a teammate, and booster away if she peels for the person you are diving.

Main thing to understand is that you'll get blamed for almost everything- it get's tiring after awhile so I'd recommend just turning the chat off and do what you want/feels right if you can't handle it.

In my case, if the enemy tank goes Zarya and I'm having alot of fun with [D.va](http://D.va), I make it my job to annoy her, constantly making her panic bubble or swarming her supports just to back out last second and confuse her on what I'm actually doing.

Tanking is honestly boring, the weight of the match is on your back, but you don't really get to do much and have to wait for opportunities- it sucks, and even I get tired of it at times. Every now and then you can just take a break from tank, maybe play other heroes you commonly struggle with to better understand their weaknesses so you can capitalize on them later.

Another way to feel good about playing and enjoying the game is peeling for supports, there's plenty of times where I'm frustrated by the end of the match but one of or both the supports on my team thank me for always being there to protect them, and it really brings the mood up for me personally.

Lastly, play attention to what your dps is doing, if you've got a reaper popping off in their backlines go group up with them sometimes to give them an out or help them cause more chaos- not every match will play the same and there's always something you can at least try to do that may turn the tide of battle.","overwatch","0"
"1337","I main Suffer Like me - Ramattra , meanwhile there are ""Counters"" to rammi there isnt any hard counter atleast until diamond 2 ( that i could feel i NEED TO CHANGE ASAP, did get diamond only playing ramma ) for being ramma , the bigger problem are always the dps , let put an example u play Rein u get Counter By orisa , it still playable 1v1 vs orisa, if u are better , but now the other dps picks are Bastion that focus you and a Phara , now u are fucked , you dps or supp need to help to counter that , but your dps are Torb and sombra ... u are pretty much fucked up , the other thing is u playstyle   
There is a clear diference betwen my rama and others , maybe because i played him so much that i can pretty much nullify any Lucio, Brid, Dva, Wins and Juno without any problem and Bap, with some effort, meanwhile i see other people play ram in the same elo and get trashed by those picks .  
There are many otp in the top game , so everything is viable if u get some tricks to it , the only tank that i can say atleast in diamond people still dont know how counter them are Zarya(U just need a phara) , Doom( u need a good Sigma/Hog) and maybe Mauga and remember as tank u cant just counter all the enemies so if u team doesnt help there isnt any miracle u can do , let say they pick Bridget  u solo kill the brid in like 1-2 seconds she cant even heal but if u team is getting one taped by a Widow .. u change to Wins to counter widow but now u team is dying to bridge Mei Orisa or u are playing Wins and they have a phara and u team doesnt pick hit scan.. or anything to counter her and she is carrying the other team then is gg","overwatch","0"
"1338","I’m a flex with ana main, winston second from korea.

1. I recommend to make a group que with supporter who can play ana, juno, kiriko.

Since you are rein/hog main, you need to approach quickly before getting damage.
And winston and ana are traditionally the best pair.
Try to keep away from mercy, moira and weaver. (They are not go well with your main😂)

2. Play zarya if you can

After season 14 perk system, zarya too strong  and hard to counter her.
I think only ball/winston dive and rein rush can counter zarya, but it’s hard in quick play or solo que comp.
And zarya’s perks can deal with most of circumstances.
Before the new patch, I think zarya is the best option not to be countered.

3. I practice all tanks to counter enemy tank or try to make the best option.
There’s a concept about rock-scissor-paper of tank. It would be helpful to play tanks.
Since there’s only one tank in OW2, you cannot run away from the counters unfortunately.","overwatch","0"
"1339","If I were you, I'd practice Winston HARD in qp, even against 5 counters. That stuff is gonna train you a lot until you feel confident enough to play him against your counters in ranked.

There's some matches that the enemy team's only mission is to make your life miserable, so don't sweat it too much. For those times, you should learn on the side a tank with little to no hard counters: Ram, Zarya, maybe Hazard or JQ.

You'll eventually get to a point you can comfortably deal with 2 or 3 counters. 5 counters I'd recommend to swap unless you're rolling them. Otherwise, just swap to one of those tanks and cash in your free win.

Personally I play mostly Ball because is the tank I find the must fun. You can imagine. My second most played tank is Hog. Same thing. I just try to play Zarya or Ram as a last resource, but sometimes you just have to if you want to have any agency in the game.","overwatch","0"
"1340","The thing about me is that the *entire reason* I began even playing hero shooters is because I'm team-oriented. Idk what it is, but I always watch my team and our surroundings. 

I love being the big ""slow"" (ofc not always the case in this game) character with a good high level of health, and sometimes a huge shield to protect teammates. It feels nice. I'm not the most aggressive player in role based games. I don't care about domination or numbers. I just like supporting others, be it healing, augments, debuffing enemies, meat shielding, you name it. Synergy's my business, and cuz, my business is a-boomin. 

I play Zar and Queen specifically because they're 2 Tanks that *directly* support the team with their abilities. Sigma ult got you? So does my Battle Shout. You little Supports getting bullied by a Genji? Not if my bubbles got you. 

If I hear a ping that isn't in front of me when I'm playing a Dive Tank, I immediately check my backline. If I see my habibis getting bullied, I'll crumple your ass and toss you back in your spawn. 

TL;DR: I just like protecting squishies :)","overwatch","0"

Any time they are close to losing, Bob leaves the game. As a result, Alice gets no penalty. Rinse and repeat, and Alice ends up with an artificial 100% winrate and climbs to higher ranks. Even if you make it count less, or if you only penalize group members, you'd still get a weaker version of the exploit.","overwatch","0"

"1347","Neither of them is really that strong, Symm is as most annoying if the team dont know how to play vs her, keep your distance and break her turret's in the first place you shouldn't be on her range unless you are someone like Reaper (who should always win vs a Symmetra) unless she is able to charge up her dmg is stupidly low.

Sombra is kinda fair she is annoying to both kill and play around but she isn't broken either her biggest counter is the team playing together deny her that kill and she isn't doing anything. 

And Ramm is stupidly easy to punish, any type of stun in his nemesis form? and he is dead, he isn't in nemesis form? he is then just tickling your team, he fucks over 3 characters Rein, Monkey and Brig, but the thing is a lot of others characters do the same.","overwatch","0"
"1348","I think anyone who just complains about a character to the point they want it gone just doesn’t have game awareness. 

Sombra is easy to play against if you have a semblance of team coordination. Sym literally has so many counters, she shouldn’t be a problem consistently. Unless of course you have no game awareness.

And Ram is easy to melt if, again you have team coordination.","overwatch","0"
"1349","For me it's widow by far.  A good or better widow is just going to take out most of the dps/support and make it so I only have a chance with a few characters.  I.e. sombra, maybe reaper, and brigitte.  Be better if people would PING the damn widows lol but no one seems to want to do that.

Ram - I've had no more trouble vs him than any other tanks.  Sometimes someone is just really good, and they'd probably crush you with 5 other tanks just as well.  Also could be a really good team that's able to keep him alive better.

Sombra - Can be very annoying but the times when I've had the most trouble was when my team just didn't help out.  So sombra was able to just keep picking away at the back lines.

Sym - I had a match the other day where I thought I was doing fairly well, not great.  We won, and at the end someone said we only won because of ""the cheapass sym"" and I was very confused lol.  I don't even remember who the other team chose, maybe they accidentally chose people weak to me?  Because I was sym from the start and don't think it was a map that was particularly pro-sym, with the point in a small enclosed area or anything.

I've definitely swapped to sym when dealing with a particularly troublesome genji or rein, but after giving it a while, when we're reaaaaaaaally getting steamrolled and I'm not getting anywhere.  But there are plenty of characters that sym has trouble with, basically anyone long range lol.  Pharah, ashe, junk, widow obviously, etc.","overwatch","0"

OW1 skins might look/feel old to people who play this game for almost a decade, but not for someone who's been playing for like 2 years, they likely don't even know about the existence of most skins.

I could Mercy pocket my gold rank friend and he is going to put way better performance and numbers on the field because having a constant source of healing and damage boost just gives you an insane advantage.

Me and my friends have banned Mercy from our choice of heroes for the exact reason that whenever we did try to pocket one of us the matches just became way too easy and boring.

And it's nothing to do with us somehow smurfing but with the fact that it's hard to lose duels against enemy DPS players when you have a Mercy pocket and they have nothing.

Yeah this could have been a smurf but I always give a benefit of the doubt when it comes down to Mercy pocketing because nearly everyone would put really good stats on the field with one.","overwatch","0"

in QP the matchmaking is not that restrictive. so you might have more higher rank players in you QP games.

on the other hand, if you havent played a lot of ranked and just now started, the matchmaker has not much data to work with for your account. it needs to check your skill level. it places you lower at first, and because the matchmaking is much more restrictive in comp you get less of a ranked range in your games.
