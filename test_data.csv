"966","Imagine, 700 years in the future, through some last vestige of the internet kept in an underground server, a notification miraculously appears on your device (which has been preserved in nuclear dust from the 5th world war). One night, an alien working a late shift at the museum of archeology notices the cracked screen suddenly light up, and upon it, one word arises from the battered code: Amogus. They do not know what this word means. They ponder it deeply. They scour the ancient tomes, desperate to understand its mystifying origin. It drives them mad. Is it a primeval cipher? The motto of a bygone civilization? A message from God? Night after night they study it by candlelight. They flip through pages in books so old, the slightest cough would turn the paper to a fine off-white powder. The answer is nowhere to be found. And then they are struck by a revelation: I was not meant to know this word. Its esoteric nature escapes my grasp for a reason. What if its meaning is too enlightening to bear? With this revelation comes anger. Spite. Despair. Why shouldn't I understand it?! What cosmic forces are there at play to keep me from such knowledge?! In a fit of desperate rage, they shatter your device against a wall and exclaim, arms raised to the heavens: ""This is literally 1984!"" Silence... Their pleas are unanswered. Sadly, in the end, their inability to unlock the word's meaning drives them to suicide. Its secrets are never known. So I ask you this: is it better to die having never understood the true mind-bending nature of Amogus, or to be driven mad by the little spaceman in his blood-red suit? If you knew enlightenment would render you incapable of living on this mortal earth without making daily references to a game of space mafia, would you accept it? With knowledge comes power, but also endless suffering.

"828","The Last impostor game I played me and my partner won, both still alive and the last double kill for the win included an AFK player because I decided to stay at the button while they chased someone else.

All I replied was “yep, and I’m not gonna say sorry if killing you = a win for me.” 
“You shouldn’t be afk anyways for the final six with 2 impostors left anyway so”

"242","It's not always as easy to rotate to dragon as it might seem. Especially the very first dragon, because of how low death timers are.  
  
Its very easy to end up in a situation where yes: you just ganked and killed the enemy and/or just crashed a wave, but they also just respawned and spent their 1200g, while your ADC/support did not get to recall and spend their gold. Your ADC/Support might also now be half HP. It only takes like 20-30 seconds (including the grey screen) after dying early to get back to lane.  
  
So while it might seem like the dragon is free, it might really be a bad idea if you take even a few seconds too long to jump onto it. The window is extremely tiny early game. During this window, if your ADC chooses to stay and help with dragon, they lose their chance to recall because the enemy will be back in lane and pushing. So, yea, you might get the dragon, but your ADC is now in a really bad position. They either need to stay in lane with half HP and sitting on 1200+g against an enemy who just spent their gold, or they need to base and just lose a whole wave of minions and possibly a turret plate too because they are so behind on tempo now.

If you are tracking the enemy jungler: You know which side of the map they are likely on once dragon and grubs are up. This will tell you which objective they are likely to go for, and also which other objective you can go for. Instead of asking your team to help kill dragon, understand that dragon or grubs can instead be taken for basically free solo as long as you aren't on the same side as the enemy jungler is and your laner's are not dead.  
Buy a control ward on your first base as a jungler and use it to secure vision inside the pit of the objective you want to solo, especially if that objective is dragon. (You usually don't need a control ward for killing first void grubs, its very very unlikely to be warded.)

That being said, i agree that at least the support should rotate towards dragon after a successful gank if they have the HP for it. Its not the end of the world for the support to be a little behind on Tempo and help secure first dragon.","league-of-legends","0","","its not always as easy to rotate to dragon as it might seem especially the very first dragon because of how low death timers are

"89","Not funny I didn't laugh. Your joke is so bad I would have preferred the joke went over my head and you gave up re-telling me the joke. To be honest this is a horrid attempt at trying to get a laugh out of me. Not a chuckle, not a hehe, not even a subtle burst of air out of my esophagus. Science says before you laugh your brain preps your face muscles but I didn't even feel the slightest twitch. 0/10 this joke is so bad I cannot believe anyone legally allowed you to be creative at all. The amount of brain power you must have put into that joke has the potential to power every house on Earth. Get a personality and learn how to make jokes, read a book. I'm not saying this to be funny I genuinely mean it on how this is just bottom barrel embarrassment at comedy. You've single handedly killed humor and every comedic act on the planet. I'm so disappointed that society has failed as a whole in being able to teach you how to be funny. Honestly if I put in all my power and time to try and make your joke funny it would require Einstein himself to build a device to strap me into so I can be connected to the energy of a billion stars to do it, and even then all that joke would get from people is a subtle scuff. You're lucky I still have the slightest of empathy for you after telling that joke otherwise I would have committed every war crime in the book just to prevent you from attempting any humor ever again. We should put that joke in text books so future generations can be wary of becoming such an absolute comedic failure. Im disappointed, hurt, and outright offended that my precious time has been wasted in my brain understanding that joke. In the time that took I was planning on helping kids who have been orphaned, but because of that you've waisted my time explaining the obscene integrity of your terrible attempt at comedy. Now those kids are suffering without meals and there's nobody to blame but you. I hope you're happy with what you have done and I truly hope you can move on and learn from this piss poor attempt","classic","1","0.0171316691140479","not funny i didnt laugh your joke is so bad i would have preferred the joke went over my head and you gave up retelling me the joke to be honest this is a horrid attempt at trying to get a laugh out of me not a chuckle not a hehe not even a subtle burst of air out of my esophagus science says before you laugh your brain preps your face muscles but i didnt even feel the slightest twitch  this joke is so bad i cannot believe anyone legally allowed you to be creative at all the amount of brain power you must have put into that joke has the potential to power every house on earth get a personality and learn how to make jokes read a book im not saying this to be funny i genuinely mean it on how this is just bottom barrel embarrassment at comedy youve single handedly killed humor and every comedic act on the planet im so disappointed that society has failed as a whole in being able to teach you how to be funny honestly if i put in all my power and time to try and make your joke funny it would require einstein himself to build a device to strap me into so i can be connected to the energy of a billion stars to do it and even then all that joke would get from people is a subtle scuff youre lucky i still have the slightest of empathy for you after telling that joke otherwise i would have committed every war crime in the book just to prevent you from attempting any humor ever again we should put that joke in text books so future generations can be wary of becoming such an absolute comedic failure im disappointed hurt and outright offended that my precious time has been wasted in my brain understanding that joke in the time that took i was planning on helping kids who have been orphaned but because of that youve waisted my time explaining the obscene integrity of your terrible attempt at comedy now those kids are suffering without meals and theres nobody to blame but you i hope youre happy with what you have done and i truly hope you can move on and learn from this piss poor attempt"

"1316","Count bubbles. Good Zaryas will:

1. Bubble early for early charge
2. Wait a second, then push
3. Bubble during the fight
4. 1st bubble resets, Zarya bubbles again

It's better to count THREE bubbles instead of two if you see the Zarya bubble early. 

When playing tanks like Dva against Zarya, you basically have to play avoid her simulator. Get on the backline, get on high ground, Force the Zarya to bubble a teammate, and booster away if she peels for the person you are diving. That gives your DPS a better window to burst her, forcing her supports to sacrifice good positioning to help, and then you can kill them, leaving Zar last if she's still alive","overwatch","0","","count bubbles good zaryas will

"294","What you’re doing OP is good! 
People saying “dont pick for comps” aren’t really saying what they mean i think.

Ideally (in general, not always) You’ll want to have a small roster of champs in your position, that fill a variety of roles for a comp.

For random example, having Galio, Syndra, Akshan , covers you if you need to round out a comp with Galio, or provide good burst with some cc on syndra, or provide some more range and ad if maybe your jg is melee AP or something.

Rough idea, but the point being that you’d want to aim for a small champ pool of champions you actually do enjoy, that you play often and well, and can pick interchangeably depending on whats more fitting.

The issue OTP’s run into, is that you’d end up playing your champ in unfavourable matchups, and just rely on being so much better at your champ that you outplay the opponent and win.

When in a much better world, you have that, but, also another couple champs to round out when you are counterpicked or have a bad matchup for your one trick.

TL:DR.
Keep up what you’re doing, limit the champ pool to a few different playstyle and role filling champs, and keep thinking about comps, it is vital knowledge to have, even if its not permanently applicable every single game. Sometimes the better move is to just pick your comfort picks and play to your strengths, sometimes its best to pick the perfect champ that you still play somewhat often. 

Good luck on the rift my goat.","league-of-legends","0","","what you’re doing op is good

keep up what you’re doing limit the champ pool to a few different playstyle and role filling champs and keep thinking about comps it is vital knowledge to have even if its not permanently applicable every single game sometimes the better move is to just pick your comfort picks and play to your strengths sometimes its best to pick the perfect champ that you still play somewhat often 

good luck on the rift my goat"

"321","It is likely because most players know where their trinket is keyed to. 8 isn't convenient to hit compared to 4 the default for most players unless they have a MMO or MOBA mouse. I use a MMO mouse and I still manage my activated items location based on where my thumb rests. 4 is the most comfortable one though so it is my trinket. 

I agree that herald on trinket is absolutely atrocious and it feels like punishment for taking an objective way too often. I wish herald had its own button to click on on screen to drop it and its own hotkey. Why should a team lose wards/sweeper/blue because they won an objective. If Riot wants herald to be non strategically used it should just summon 3 mini heralds one in each lan when it is taken or something else.

"432","I'm not an adc player but hover high gold/low plat. My take on Ashe is she is a utility adc kind of like Jhin. Your damage is not the best and you function as more of a supportive champ than the main carry unless you are ungodly fed. Ashe/Jhin are better in a more coordinated environment where your team can play around your ability to make picks with arrow/slows. Bronze elo is not that and there are much better picks to 1v9 irrespective of if your team is running it down or not. 

Ashe also has no mobility and relies on kiting your opponents effectively which if you are bronze you are not able to do. Like someone said Ashe actually requires more skill than other ADC champs for this reason.

At the end of the day I'd say if your goal is just climbing I'd play a different role. If you are actually better than other bronze players, playing a champ/role with more ability to get things done independently is the way to go instead of praying to god your support isn't a bot and you don't get 1 shot every teamfight.","league-of-legends","0","","im not an adc player but hover high goldlow plat my take on ashe is she is a utility adc kind of like jhin your damage is not the best and you function as more of a supportive champ than the main carry unless you are ungodly fed ashejhin are better in a more coordinated environment where your team can play around your ability to make picks with arrowslows bronze elo is not that and there are much better picks to v irrespective of if your team is running it down or not

"897","Hey, someone who got banned here!

I was permabanned for toxic behavior and  was told the decision would not be reversed, but actually was reversed.

You should appeal to innersloth through their site:

1. Go to their website

2. at the bottom of the page, there is a link with Help & FAQ section, click it.

3. next you should see accounts & Billing, click on that. at the very top of that page, there is a section about           being banned, click that.

4. After you've been redirected to that page, go to the very bottom of the page where it says to dispute a permanent ban, that should redirect you to the appeal section.

Now, as for the actual appealing, here's what I did to get unbanned:

I expressed remorse for my actions, I did not make any sob stories or give excuses, just telling them that I goofed up, said that I understand that my actions negatively impacted the players and the game and that I'd never do it again.

My first appeal was denied, I was told the decision was final, I thought that was it, still I felt that while I was an asshole, I wasn't an asshole to a degree, it warranted an instant permaban, so I applied a month later.

I went through the same song and dance, expressing regret and I was back in the game.

(All of this was done through email, when they didn't have an appeal system)

After I got unbanned, I don't even swear in game anymore, because I do believe that the innersloth crew was being gracious with me, even if I most likely got spam reported on racism and hacking, but I'm still not risking it with even mildy bad behavior.

  
After the appeal process, all you can do is hope that your appeal is accepted.

Best of luck appealing your case, I'm rooting for you!","among-us","0","","hey someone who got banned here

i was permabanned for toxic behavior and  was told the decision would not be reversed but actually was reversed

you should appeal to innersloth through their site

They cant even really nerf sojourn bc damage is all she has, without it she isnt a character. She has no utility.

Mei has her wall, her invul and an ult that can shut down the enemy team. Symmetra has her turrets, teleporter and giant Shield wall.  
You can comfortably nerf their damage bc they provide more than just dps.

Even pure dmg characters like widow are mostly fine bc sniping is ALL she can really do. Shes not gonna ever top the dps charts, its pick or nothing.

But the canadian? She has all the strengths of characters entire kits without the downsides minus any utility.

"150","People in this thread talking about Yuumi or Garen (fuck Garen, all my homies hate Garen, genuinely disgusting champ to play against) being worse than Yi either always played with CC-heavy comps against Yi or they never played against a semi-competent (aka breathing and not blind) Yi player back in the day (holy shit I am old).

Legit there was nothing quite as terrifying as Yi reaching 25 minutes into the game, being 0/1/2 and then pressing R and sprinting at your adc when you only had one or two targeted CC's that could hit him reliably.

Skillshot CC? Unreliable and he has the advantage to dodge because of his ult and Q.

Targeted? Still has Q

You waited for after the Q to target him? Tough fucking luck, your squishy is dead and now he has Q again

You zone him and try to burst him? W damage reduction and a ton of lifesteal 

Was he unbeatable? No, of course not. But he was very much the crown prince of ""You didn't counter me in champ select by magically foreseeing that I, the last pick, wanted Yi and now no fight is gonna be on your terms ever past 25 minutes"" which made him super frustrating in low elo especially because Yi has enough tools to dodge/bait CC rather than just face tank it like, say, Garen","league-of-legends","0","","people in this thread talking about yuumi or garen fuck garen all my homies hate garen genuinely disgusting champ to play against being worse than yi either always played with ccheavy comps against yi or they never played against a semicompetent aka breathing and not blind yi player back in the day holy shit i am old

"1155","Siege is a slower game that uses slower pacing and faster time to kill as its lens for strategy. The gunplay isn’t inherently easy, but the slow pace of the game means you can *choose* to play in a way that minimizes your dependency on mechanics, and in a way that will decrease the level of variance involved in your strategy. You have very few times you have to think on your toes if you prepare adequately for, or even outright deny, the enemy team’s options.

In Overwatch, there’s still strategy, but the hard gunplay will seek you out. You can’t simply choose to push slower, quieter, or with more utility to clear corners; you need to be able to juggle your strategy *and* carry out difficult mechanical fights at the same time. The pace of gameplay being so much higher means you can’t always predict every outcome, and you’ll need to be able to deal with parts of your strategy falling apart and think quickly enough to deal with it as well as possible.

It’s really just because it’s a different game. Siege is a *tactical* shooter, so it’s always going to be slower—and that lends itself well to being able to separate strategy and gunplay. You don’t have that luxury with Overwatch, and it’s okay for your friend not to like Overwatch for that reason! The game isn’t for everyone.","overwatch","0","","siege is a slower game that uses slower pacing and faster time to kill as its lens for strategy the gunplay isn’t inherently easy but the slow pace of the game means you can choose to play in a way that minimizes your dependency on mechanics and in a way that will decrease the level of variance involved in your strategy you have very few times you have to think on your toes if you prepare adequately for or even outright deny the enemy team’s options

"1336","I'm a flex player who typically ends up playing tank 9/10. Self proclaimed [D.va](http://D.va) main but that's mainly from ow1, she just doesn't feel quite right in 5v5, but she's still my go to most of the time.

Main thing to understand is that you'll get blamed for almost everything- it get's tiring after awhile so I'd recommend just turning the chat off and do what you want/feels right if you can't handle it. Probably the biggest thing with tank is learning what your threshold is, when to back out or push forward, etc. When I play, I typically find myself a dps and a support to hover around, making sure I don't go too far away from either when pushing or falling back.

My best advice to actually enjoy the game is to just be stubborn. In my case, if the enemy tank goes Zarya and I'm having alot of fun with [D.va](http://D.va), I make it my job to annoy her, constantly making her panic bubble or swarming her supports just to back out last second and confuse her on what I'm actually doing.

Tanking is honestly boring, the weight of the match is on your back, but you don't really get to do much and have to wait for opportunities- it sucks, and even I get tired of it at times. Every now and then you can just take a break from tank, maybe play other heroes you commonly struggle with to better understand their weaknesses so you can capitalize on them later.

Another way to feel good about playing and enjoying the game is peeling for supports, there's plenty of times where I'm frustrated by the end of the match but one of or both the supports on my team thank me for always being there to protect them, and it really brings the mood up for me personally.

Lastly, play attention to what your dps is doing, if you've got a reaper popping off in their backlines go group up with them sometimes to give them an out or help them cause more chaos- not every match will play the same and there's always something you can at least try to do that may turn the tide of battle.","overwatch","0","","im a flex player who typically ends up playing tank  self proclaimed dva main but thats mainly from ow she just doesnt feel quite right in v but shes still my go to most of the time

"380","I miss when Runes used to get like reworked/reinvented every two seasons or so.  
Just mixing up the game kept it feeling fresh.  
We have had basically the same runes for like 5 years now and its just kind of bland.  
Other than maybe Lethal Tempo getting multiple spicy changes throughout the years, the majority of the runes have been pretty standard and homogenous.

I feel like the game used to get a lot more broad changes just to keep the game interesting. But they have become more and more afraid of large changes because they don't want to upset the esport balance, i think.

Even things like the Mythical item system. Even though overall it was sort of a flop, i still want to see more things like that. I want to see them be creative and have big idea and try big things.

How about new summoner spells?

There used to be a lot more niche items to choose from, i feel like. And now the majority of items are kind of ""pidgeon-holed"" for specific champion archtypes instead of being freeform. Instead of choosing to build a damage item and then a defensive item, which gave you a lot of specific choices on exactly how you wanted to get your damage and exactly how you need your defense, and instead you now just get a whole stack of bruiser items that have basically every stat you need in one. No real choice anymore.   
You used to need to choose if you wanted to build high AP, high cooldown, or high mana, but now you kind of just get items that provide all three, no real choice to be made.

You used to get to choose 3 crit items and then two situational items on an ADC which really made a big difference in build diversity, choices and adaptability for crit users. Now you basically just have a huge slew of 25% crit items, most of which are bad, and you don't have room for any real situational items in most games.","league-of-legends","0","","i miss when runes used to get like reworkedreinvented every two seasons or so

"180","To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase ""Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Rick and Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.

"928","I'd say these are fairly normal ""serious"" difficulty settings. I recommend dropping imp vision to at least 3x. Depending on the device, 5x vision can cause the game to get a little laggy. Most likely to have a straight horizontal line or two through the middle of the screen. You don't need a high vision to see the entirety of your surroundings on the majority of maps. 

Your settings do check my biggest pet peeve in this game, though. No lobby should ever have more than two difficulties selected, imo. When searching for lobbies, the only difficulty I have selected is expert. I'm not looking to play in casual or beginner lobbies due to experience gaps. 

My personal vision of an expert lobby has anon votes, confirm ejects off, no roles at easily predictable percentages, two of each impostor roles. Unpredictable settings create  challenges for both imps and crew. I don't expect this from random lobbies, but it would be great as a seasoned player to have the opportunity more often. 

I'd only stay in your lobby if the people were enjoyable to play with due to the four lobby filters.

"774","Best bet is probably to pair it with the charge and hallucination strategy. So i propose 2 orbital halos. Thats potentially 2 free procs and 39 damage for 8 mana if you go Angel hp 1, Chronoboost hp 6, orbital halo hp 10, orbital halo hp 14, hallucination hp 26, hallcination hp 39 dmg.

So 39 damage for 8 mana with 6 of it being attached to your hero in optimal conditions. With sing along buddy its 10 mana 12 + 45 damage.

I’d drop deckhand and fan club first probably.

"751","I have done this achievement on several accounts. My method is probably different than most. Rather than try to win games, which can take awhile, I would seek to lose them as fast as possible. So I made a warlock with what I call self hurt cards. The goal being to kill yourself by turn 3-5. And it is actually very easy to do.

Now with one of the legendary cards needed and added to your deck, each game will net you some points as you seek to get to the total 7200. Also while your doing that you will get other golden cards awarded to you along the way, wild of course, for a few different classes.

Another thing you can do is when you get daily quests for play 3 warlock games, that's always nice to knock out real quick with this deck, no need to win. Hero power quests, mana quests, battlecry quests, shadow spell, other misc. quests can be done with this deck.

This achievement will take some time, but the games go quick, and usually what I did was just read or watch stuff online while knocking them out, with quests sometimes, etc. Depending on how much you go at it, could be a month, or could be longer. Id say for myself it was one of the two, a month or so.

"876","Ok, so I was playing the hit game Among Us the other day, and when the game started, a red bean-shaped character that appeared to be wearing a spacesuit told me ""shh,"" while having his index finger in front of where his mouth should be. I believe this act made this red bean character extremely suspicious. To understand why this red bean character is suspicious, we first must understand how the game “Among Us” works. The game consists of 10 bean-shaped characters, called crewmates, that are given tasks for them to complete. As these characters do their tasks, they may witness abnormal things that are not supposed to happen, such as the lights turning off on their own, sudden reactor meltdown and other crewmates dying. These acts show that there is an imposter among the crewmates that is sabotaging and is trying to kill everyone. Now why is this important to determine why the red bean is suspicious? Well now we know how the game works, now we must analyze the red bean’s actions. At the beginning of the game, the red bean tells us “shh” while having his index finger in front of where his mouth should be. This action suggests that the red bean wants us to be quiet, or keep our mouths shut. Now why would the red bean want us to do this? This could be because the red bean wants to limit our communication in order to prevent us from spreading information. What information does the red bean want to prevent from spreading? We can assume that the reason why the red bean wants to prevent us from spreading information, is because he is actually the imposter, and he is planning on committing the crimes mentioned earlier. He does not want others to find out about actions he will cause, therefore he does not want us to communicate with each other. This concludes the reason for why I believe the red bean from the hit game Among Us is suspicious. So if you happen to see a red bean-shaped character wearing a spacesuit, please be careful.","among-us","1","0.0225294418842805","ok so i was playing the hit game among us the other day and when the game started a red beanshaped character that appeared to be wearing a spacesuit told me shh while having his index finger in front of where his mouth should be i believe this act made this red bean character extremely suspicious to understand why this red bean character is suspicious we first must understand how the game “among us” works the game consists of  beanshaped characters called crewmates that are given tasks for them to complete as these characters do their tasks they may witness abnormal things that are not supposed to happen such as the lights turning off on their own sudden reactor meltdown and other crewmates dying these acts show that there is an imposter among the crewmates that is sabotaging and is trying to kill everyone now why is this important to determine why the red bean is suspicious well now we know how the game works now we must analyze the red bean’s actions at the beginning of the game the red bean tells us “shh” while having his index finger in front of where his mouth should be this action suggests that the red bean wants us to be quiet or keep our mouths shut now why would the red bean want us to do this this could be because the red bean wants to limit our communication in order to prevent us from spreading information what information does the red bean want to prevent from spreading we can assume that the reason why the red bean wants to prevent us from spreading information is because he is actually the imposter and he is planning on committing the crimes mentioned earlier he does not want others to find out about actions he will cause therefore he does not want us to communicate with each other this concludes the reason for why i believe the red bean from the hit game among us is suspicious so if you happen to see a red beanshaped character wearing a spacesuit please be careful"

"913","The creation of Among Us and it's consequences have been a disaster for the human race. Just a few months after youtubers and twitch streamers brought it to fame, it had been loaded with kids infested with the hype of the game among us. Furthermore, the constant use of Among us had rendered the game boring, as it entered the downfall stage of a game's popularity, just like Fall Guys. However, this is not something you should celebrate; since the constant use had also brought a new genre or era of memes, often referred to as post-irony. A bastardized version of Among Us called ""Amogus"" was used for the game in these meme's contexts, going viral in the Urban Dictionary. All the cultures of normie memes and pre-2020 memes have been wiped off as the ""Amogus"" meme exploded. Post irony has caused a greater disaster where everybody sees things as the crewmate in the mobile game Among Us. As memes began referring to everything as the crewmate, people have been driven to insanity. People who used to be normal looking at memes were now infected by the Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon, which renders everything as something they've seen constantly. ""Amogus Everywhere"" is the bastardized name of the Phenomenon. Capitalistic-driven people have been competing for a Amogus-crewmate chicken nugget, costing $100,000 at an auction. I hope life returns to normal as Among Us and Amogus have been wiped of the face of this Earth.","among-us","1","0.0281096275474349","the creation of among us and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race just a few months after youtubers and twitch streamers brought it to fame it had been loaded with kids infested with the hype of the game among us furthermore the constant use of among us had rendered the game boring as it entered the downfall stage of a games popularity just like fall guys however this is not something you should celebrate since the constant use had also brought a new genre or era of memes often referred to as postirony a bastardized version of among us called amogus was used for the game in these memes contexts going viral in the urban dictionary all the cultures of normie memes and pre memes have been wiped off as the amogus meme exploded post irony has caused a greater disaster where everybody sees things as the crewmate in the mobile game among us as memes began referring to everything as the crewmate people have been driven to insanity people who used to be normal looking at memes were now infected by the baadermeinhof phenomenon which renders everything as something theyve seen constantly amogus everywhere is the bastardized name of the phenomenon capitalisticdriven people have been competing for a amoguscrewmate chicken nugget costing  at an auction i hope life returns to normal as among us and amogus have been wiped of the face of this earth"

"955","Depends on your lobby.  Usually, yes.  The problem isn't the roles though, it's the players.  The game is pretty boring if you're not playing with engaged people (the majority of public lobby players).

If I get vanilla crewmate and I head left on Skeld and I do my vials task and then start going to reactor but a meeting gets called, well I haven't really done anything with my 30 seconds.  My contribution to the meeting, where all the actual fun in this game is to be had, will simply be ""I went left"" (and maybe I saw a person which, while helpful, may or may not actually matter).  If there's one guy saying ""it's red.  trust"" and nobody else says anything then, well, I'm not really having a great time.  As long as I didn't see red go left with me then I'm just kinda voting randomly.  Feels bad man.

The roles simply give players something to do if they get stuck as crewmate in a lame public lobby game.  Sure, I went left and have no helpful information, but at least I know the time of death because I was scientist.  Or I could vent to electrical because I'm engineer.  It's not much but the quality of these games lives and dies with the meetings currently, and roles are a way to spice up the out-of-meeting experience at least a little bit.

The social deduction and hidden roles game NEEDS social deduction around the hidden roles because there is little to no game here to hold the experience up if nobody is talking during a meeting.

Also, the default settings for a lot of roles are TERRIBLE which means players may have one or two experiences with a role/the roles and go ""this sucks, I'm turning them off"" and then their mind is made up.","among-us","0","","depends on your lobby  usually yes  the problem isnt the roles though its the players  the game is pretty boring if youre not playing with engaged people the majority of public lobby players

"331","I'm only saying this because you specifically stated ""3 rankeds,"" but if Riot were to implement this, literally no one could play - and no, that's not an exaggeration.  

Have you ever watched pro players stream? EVERY pro player has streaks of losses, which means every person on Earth who plays the game has streaks of losses. Just watch Broxah - dude has loss streaks all the time.  

If you wanna say 20 games of straight losses, then *maaaaybe* we could talk, but even then, there's so many factors that would have to be analyzed and confirmed before issuing a proper temp ban.  

Tbf, I understand your sentiment of wanting people to play the game as long as they're in a good mental and emotional state. But that's simply not human. Some people are broken, some are addicted, some are hurting, some are tilted, and some are just having bad luck or an unfortunate streak. It happens all the time, every day.  

I say this to anyone who plays the game, wants to get better, and will listen: league is a 10% test of your skill and a 90% test of your mental. That includes int'ing, trolling, and griefing teammates. We can't control what others do, but we can control our own gameplay and adapt. It's proven the better you keep your mental, the better you play and thus, the more you win.  

So yea, you can be mad at your teammates for carrying their loss streaks into your games, but it won't change anything, because that will always happen. Always. Take a look at your own loss streaks. You're telling me that if you ever get 3 losses in a row you shouldn't play? And think about that answer carefully, because if you say yes, then you probably need to rethink the state of yourself than you do your ""loss-streak"" teammates.","league-of-legends","0","","im only saying this because you specifically stated  rankeds but if riot were to implement this literally no one could play  and no thats not an exaggeration

"936","I was dashing around the office. Everyone looked at me weird. I was screaming, ""SUS! SUS! AMOGUS!"" Everyone started chanting with me. ""SUS! SUS! AMOGUS! AMONG SUS! WHEN THE IMPOSTER IS SUS!"" We all did the Among Us beatbox in unison. It was beautiful. Like a horse waving its mane in the air on a bright and pretty day. But suddenly I noticed; one of the kids wasn't doing the Among Drip beatbox! So I ran over to her.

""Hey kid,"" I said, ""Stop being an asparagus or whatever your dumb star signs are and be not sussy with us!"" She looked at me weird and said ""Whatever, old man."" That was so disrespectful and SUS of her! So I put my hands around her neck and twisted her head off ""Like in that one kill animation in Among Us.""

Everyone looked at me in horror, even the ones who were Among Beatboxing with me! Everyone was looking at me like I had just sexually abused a Syrian 4 year old refugee (which I had done before.) I said ""What?"" when suddenly the elevator opened. It was the CEO of Pepsi-co! I noticed the Pepsi pin on her shirt and said ""When the Pepsi is sus!"" because it reminded me of the Among Us crewmate .I did the sussy Among Us beatbox. You know the one? It goes; ding ding ding ding ding ding ding, ding ding ding! BM BM! You know the one!

But, before I could finish it, I noticed; her boobs were big! I took my finger and poked her titty that was almost bursting out of her shirt. ""Booba."" I said. She had a face more horrified than anyone in the room, like before when everyone looked at me last week like I murdered Bosnian children. You remember that, right? She screamed ""SECURITY!""

Two buff men with pecs almost as big as hers and clothes so tight you could see their 12-pack abs through the shirt tackled me. I said ""That's a bit SUSSY!"" (Like how the guy said it in the ""STOP POSTING ABOUT AMONG US"" rant. ""You're not wholesome Keanu Chungus 100 Fortnite bad TikTok cringe Minecraft & Reddit good."" I said. I got out and kicked their nuts. Although they were big, (not as big as my magnum mega-cock, you know like the size of Danny Devito's?) they still cried when I kicked their nuts.

""You fucking cracker-jacks! You're Tik-Tokers trying to invade Reddit!"" I screamed. I dashed for the door but an alarm started blaring and steel barriers went down over the windows. I barely slid out of the door before the steel door closed under me. I heard the alarms blaring even from inside. I started running, running away trying to flee the scene. Not even half a mile away I saw a SWAT police car dash by me.

It started to slow down, oh shit, they noticed me! I jumped into a nearby bush and hid, hoping he wouldn't see me. Quickly, a bunch of men fully armed with automatic rifles and heavy armor came out of the back, scoping the area around.

""We can't let him get away!"" I heard one of them yell. Were they talking about me? I didn't do anything sus, at least if murder, sexual harassment, and assault don't count as being sus. I stayed still, not even making a sound.

A few minutes in, I heard my dickhole queef. It didn't make that much of a sound but I just barely saw out of the bush, the SWAT team start looking around. Shit. They heard my cock fart. I couldn't move as it would make too much noise. Eventually, after a while of looking, they just left. I was free. I quickly got out and ran, but making sure to run behind the bushes so I wouldn't be spotted.

I eventually got into the main part of the city. The town wasn't all that big, but it was big enough for me to hide. I did it. I really did it. I had gotten away.

Eventually, I made it far. Far out of town. I can't even tell Reddit where I am. It's too secret. I'm currently living a secret life in my inconspicuous location.

"593","Some imbues are basically capped, for example, once you have imbued 10 times as a priest player, your hero power doesn't benefit from any further imbues, you don't get offered minions that cost more than 10 for a more than 10 mana reduction. Same with Paladin.

Shaman can't get minions over 10 mana either, I believe, so they are effectively capped too.

Hunter, Mage and Druid are the ones that have a bit that seems to be effectively uncapped. 

Having said that, Hunter and Mage can only play so many imbue cards (4 neutral minions, and 4 class minions).

Druid is the only one that seems to be truly uncapped if you are using [[Hamuul Runetotem]] and generating a lot of nature spells. They did seem to try to make that a bit harder by printing some not so great nature spells this expansion.

It is looking to be shaping up to be a slower meta, but there are faster decks that should (hopefully!) prevent Druid from getting to the very extreme.

I could be wrong though.","hearthstone","0","","some imbues are basically capped for example once you have imbued  times as a priest player your hero power doesnt benefit from any further imbues you dont get offered minions that cost more than  for a more than  mana reduction same with paladin

"1083","Odd, I really enjoy playing tank in OW2, probably more than in OW1 tbh. I feel like an older brother protecting his younger siblings, plus I mute chat so I never have to hear anyone whining about shit I'm doing wrong. On the flip side, I feel like a raid boss vs the enemy team, if I ever see anyone other than the other tank isolated, I just pop a cooldown and kill them. Plus since I'm the pace setter, I can play at whatever pace I want. Nothing I hate more than wanting to play aggressive, but getting stuck with a tank player that's super defensive. In my experience your supports want to heal you, so so long as you aren't literally just jumping into the backline and breaking LOS, they'll often go with whatever pace you are setting.

"609","It's easily warrior for pure value. 


Warrior has a strong control archetype in most expansions. This deck gives you quite a few core cards to the general playstyle. You'll also get significant dust once the announced nerfs hit, allowing you to recraft anything you want with it.


It also provides core neutral cards for any other class that plays the game. So it's also the most flexible.


Even aggro Decks use some of those core cards warrior provides. 


Or. Alternatively, going through the list. Death Knight is little value, with one of the legendaries given out for free. 


Asteroid is a strong deck, but will only let you play shaman, and only asteroid shaman. Very few cards translate to other classes, or even other shaman Decks.


Paladin isn't played right now.


Hunter and mage has the same issue shaman does. Less so  because the cards are slightly better. But you'd better enjoy the playstyle because that's what you're playing.


I'd rank those options, warrior >>>>> hunter >> mage = shaman

"1236","So in Overwatch there's a design pattern called favor-the-shooter, it means that in latent (laggy) situations, someone shooting or using an ability has the benefit of being the writer of history as it were. This is why sometimes you get hit after ducking behind cover; from the shooter's POV you were still visible and the game honored that.

So with that in mind, I think Suzu is inherently missing the flag that says it should be considered ""a shooter"". Contrasting Bap's Lantern which will in fact reach back and save teammates through latency, Suzu does not.

Value-generating hero powers have been very impactful in the past. Even the 1 in 5 that Boom would create a card was meta-defining, let alone consistently, a strong pool (class only) and with a scaling discount (you can even find more imbues). 

Having infinite resources available means you can build a really light and consistent deck. This also avoids the draw inconsistencies that you had with Hero cards, since you can run several Imbues. I'm gonna say the weak Priest set means it won't be strong right away, but it will be a menace in later sets.","hearthstone","0","","the priest set sucks overall but id argue this is the strongest imbue youll typically get a proactive and a reactive option so this is rarely dead valuegenerating hero powers have been very impactful in the past even the  in  that boom would create a card was metadefining let alone consistently a strong pool class only and with a scaling discount you can even find more imbues

The new set comes with a massive balance patch that heavily nerfs infestor along with most other meta relevant cards from the previous format. 

The rotation and naturally smaller card pool means it will be easier to keep up with standard starting now, as opposed to had you started when there were already 2-3 additional sets in the format from the previous year.","hearthstone","0","","i think if ever there was a time to come back now is a good one

"161","Honestly maybe I’m jumping the gun here but based on what I’ve seen so far - this year HLE should definitely be favored to win no?

His team is IMO the most cracked one in the LCK right now, and whilst GENG and T1 both have good players, there are concerns about how Doran typically performs at internationals and how Duro will perform as a rookie. By contrast, HLE is filled with 5 insanely talented and generally consistent players at international events. 

I haven’t seen much LPL though but if TES is their best team (it’s prob not), I think it should be pretty favored to HLE. 

I also think the removal of lane swaps and full fearless draft will be insanely beneficial to HLE, For example, Zeus has shown to have an absolute cracked champion ocean and is one of the best solo laners in the world. I also think Zeka can definitely pull out some crazy picks in late fearless that will surprise people. All around, I’m excited for the potential of this roster

I don't know where people got this idea from. At no point have the developers said that it's the point of the whole game, and every active stance they've taken on the matter suggests that they *don't want* people to feel compelled to swap.

So if the developers don't want players to feel like they have to swap, and most of the players don't want to feel like they have to swap, why are there some few players who so confidently insist that *having to counterswap is the whole point of the game*?

"854","Tbh this is probably the most well-structured one of these I’ve seen.

Last Impostor: Love it, interesting idea, there are some specific roles for this in mods, like the Underdog.

Flashlight Mode: I would make it so that there are no flashlights with lights on and they only turn on with lights off, they would be a separate setting like vision where you could dictate their range.

X-ray Vision: Instead of making it a separate setting I would just make it so that when you clicked past the 5.0x vision it would be the next thing

Filter Changes: I don’t agree with this. The sabo cooldown idea is great, but I wouldn’t want to change the filters to restrict certain types of game play. Maybe you can just break up the various things you put into extreme mode into separate in-lobby settings that can be enabled.

Wall Change: From what I’ve heard Inner Sloth has already said that being able to see phantom/ss animations through walls is an intended feature of the game (which is really dumb, I get not wanting to have people go into corners and have half the animation not visible, but just make the game push them away from a wall so that the animation becomes more visible instead.)

Snatcher: The same as the Doppelgänger role in TOHE, so that is cool, mimicking the style of speech and play of other players can be difficult, but lots of fun. In TOHE it is a neutral killer, but I can imagine it being an impostor role just as well.

Detector: I like this a lot, not too OP (telling you who impostor is) just letting you know they are there.

Anyway, I will be saving this post. Great suggestions :)","among-us","0","","tbh this is probably the most wellstructured one of these i’ve seen

"490","I've had this idea in my head for like a year so I just needed to throw it out there. It would be cool if some DK cards had “empty” slots, meaning you could run them in a lot more rune combinations, but they’ll be weaker if you don’t meet the rune requirement. It would achieve the result of preventing players from running very powerful cards all in the same deck, while also allowing more flexibility with deck building. It also addresses the issue of only getting 10 cards a set but only certain runes getting support.

For example, Quartzite Crusher can only be run in UBF, BFF, BBF, but with empty slots weaker versions could also be run in BBB, BBU, BUU, FFF, FFU, etc.","hearthstone","0","","ive had this idea in my head for like a year so i just needed to throw it out there it would be cool if some dk cards had “empty” slots meaning you could run them in a lot more rune combinations but they’ll be weaker if you don’t meet the rune requirement it would achieve the result of preventing players from running very powerful cards all in the same deck while also allowing more flexibility with deck building it also addresses the issue of only getting  cards a set but only certain runes getting support

Once rotation happens, then yes, you can dust your originals *if you want to*, but bear two things in mind.

1. When the Core Set ones rotate back out, you'd no longer have the card unless you recraft it. This is at least a year in the future, so you may decide this isn't something worth worrying about, but it is something you should consider.

2. In certain scenarios, such as Twist* and the occasional Brawl, you can't use the Core version. Again, this may not be a concern, but you should be aware of it.

The speech was pretty boring, but there came a point in his presentation where he said ""I know there are some students among us who have been subject to bullying."" Honestly, I couldn't believe my ears. I thought, ""There is no way the speaker just said Among Us.""

I decided to troll the speaker by standing up and yelling ""When the imposter is sus!"" while making a huge grin (just like in the memes). To my surprise, no one laughed. Everyone fell dead silent and looked at me. The speaker said ""I'm sorry, what was that?"" I decided to explain to everyone what I was talking about, and said ""Get it guys? It's from Among Us."" Still, no one understood the reference. I turned towards my friend Caleb (I know him from band), and said ""You get it, right? It's from among us!"" However, he had his head buried into his lap. I looked at my friend Dalton (He plays the trumpet in band, just like I do), and yelled ""Dalton, do you get the joke????"" He didn't even make eye contact. Suddenly, the assistant principal came up behind me and said ""Please sit down, this is a school assembly."" I screamed back at her ""SCHOOL ASSEMBLY?? MORE LIKE EMERGENCY MEETING!"" I then naruto ran down to the stage, pointed at the assistant principal, and said ""SHE'S SUS!!! I SAW HER FAKE A SCAN IN MEDBAY!"" Still, no one laughed. I then said ""I'm not the imposter, I was in vents the whole time!!"" (referencing a meme). No one understood the reference. I saw people whispering to each other, but no one laughed. I then made a face resembling the ""big chungus"" meme, and said ""You guys don't get it?? That's not very Wholesome 100."" When I realized no one was laughing, I yelled ""Don't any of you guys use reddit?"" The audience was dead silent, until someone yelled ""Sit down!"" (which was very rude and not wholesome) I pointed back at him and shouted ""You're breathtaking!!"" I don't think anyone got the joke becaude no one laughed, so I said ""Do you guys know who Keanu Reeves is?"" No one responded, which is kind of cringe because I thought that at least SOMEONE would know who Keanu is.

I ended up getting escorted to the principal's office and getting suspended for a week, but in my opinion, it was totally worth it. I trolled EVERYONE. I'm gonna forever go down in Reddit history.

"1251","Stop autopiloting and analyze those losses for mistakes. You probably got more and more tilted and played worse and worse.

1. Chill. Rank doesn't matter. Streaks too - games are individual instances, they do not lead to each other. Ignore past results
2. Every 3 losses in a row take a 15 minute breather break. Do something not related to Overwatch.
3. Start gaming session with reviewing last-session's losses. Focus only on yourself (ignore mistakes of teammates even if they objectively 100% lost you game) and only on game-sense and decision making, not mechanics like aiming (unless you spot it's really bad, then you can practice aim separately) so that you can create \*actionable\* points for you to do in next games. For example you spot that you hold your ultimate for too long -> focus on it and force yourself to utilize ult to win fights. Or reverse, where fight is obviously won (like 2-3 easy picks and some ults from teammate were used), but you used your ult anyway for giggles -> focus on tracking who is dead and who used which ult. Maybe get a paper to write those actions and check after game if you did them and reflect if it helped.
4. If 3 is hard at start (e.g. you don't know what to look for, what mistakes are and generally not very analytical) - get coaching for 1-2 sessions and record it. If coach is good, he will ask a lot of questions and try to bring your mistakes through your understanding of the game instead of simply telling you what you did wrong. Simply listening for this worn't help, you need to actively think ""what and why"" so that it sticks.

If you don't focus on process (aka own gameplay and mistakes) you will follow same problem as you currently face - you will think about random useless stuff and think it's rigged etc. You need to fill your head with useful stuff so that you don't autopilot.","overwatch","0","","stop autopiloting and analyze those losses for mistakes you probably got more and more tilted and played worse and worse

""Pardon me, milady...but could you ring me up? A shame I don't have your number or I'd ring you up instead...""

she giggles and takes the game, blushing as her fingers brush mine due to my fingerless gloves

her eyes widen as she reads the game's title

""Wow, I've never seen anyone buy this before! You must have special taste!""

I smile and ready a witty response when suddenly a voice rings out from behind

""Hahaha look at what this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ is buying! That's not Call of Duty Advanced Memefare! What a piece of ♥♥♥♥!""

I quickly turn around, my cloak billowing behind me, to discern the source of the rude outburst

generic dudebro caricature with a sports team cap and ""the guy that beat you up that one time behind the school in early October"" shirt is standing there guffawing

""Excuse me sir...you may disparage my person if you wish, but it is untoward to swear in front of a lady.""

""♥♥♥♥ you ♥♥♥♥♥♥!""

I smile quietly and tip my fedora low across my eyes, concealing them

""As you wish...""

I quickly swing my cane into his kneecap before he can react

he bellows and charges forward

I expertly sidestep him and the cashier screams as he crashes into the counter

I draw my sword-cane and mutter a quiet oath as I drive it deep into his back

""...requiescat in pace...""

As I clean my blade the girl walks out from behind the counter, twirling her hair with her fingers

""So...maybe you'd like to come over to my place to play that game sometime...?

""No thanks, milady, it's only single player. Besides...""

I sheath my sword

"962","So today in school, my English teacher was having us do presentation in front of our class. For my presentation, I decided to troll my entire class by making my entire slideshow about the popular game, Among Us. I started off the presentation by showing the class the picture of the Among Us imposter wearing sneakers (it's a meme on google if you want to search for it). For some reason, no one laughed at the meme. My teacher told me ""this isn't what your presentation is supposed to be about."" I responded by yelling ""THE TEACHER IS SUS I SAW HER VENT"" and then naruto running around the room. Again, no one even giggled. I assume it's because it was forst bell and everyone was tired. My teacher said ""Please sit down."" But I wasn't about to give up. I made a last ditch effort to make everyone laugh. I started to beatbox the Among Us theme song trap remix. I was beatboxing it so well (i had practiced it at home), i was certain that everyone would burst out in laughter. Unfortunately, not a single person laughed. Everyone was staring at me, so I said ""You guys are all sussy, I'm gonna eject you"".

Long story short, I ended up getting a bad grade on my presentation and I got a detention. However, it was worth it because I totally got to troll my entire class.","among-us","1","0.036978756884343","so today in school my english teacher was having us do presentation in front of our class for my presentation i decided to troll my entire class by making my entire slideshow about the popular game among us i started off the presentation by showing the class the picture of the among us imposter wearing sneakers its a meme on google if you want to search for it for some reason no one laughed at the meme my teacher told me this isnt what your presentation is supposed to be about i responded by yelling the teacher is sus i saw her vent and then naruto running around the room again no one even giggled i assume its because it was forst bell and everyone was tired my teacher said please sit down but i wasnt about to give up i made a last ditch effort to make everyone laugh i started to beatbox the among us theme song trap remix i was beatboxing it so well i had practiced it at home i was certain that everyone would burst out in laughter unfortunately not a single person laughed everyone was staring at me so i said you guys are all sussy im gonna eject you

"1349","For me it's widow by far.  A good or better widow is just going to take out most of the dps/support and make it so I only have a chance with a few characters.  I.e. sombra, maybe reaper, and brigitte.  Be better if people would PING the damn widows lol but no one seems to want to do that.

Ram - I've had no more trouble vs him than any other tanks.  Sometimes someone is just really good, and they'd probably crush you with 5 other tanks just as well.  Also could be a really good team that's able to keep him alive better.

Sombra - Can be very annoying but the times when I've had the most trouble was when my team just didn't help out.  So sombra was able to just keep picking away at the back lines.

Sym - I had a match the other day where I thought I was doing fairly well, not great.  We won, and at the end someone said we only won because of ""the cheapass sym"" and I was very confused lol.  I don't even remember who the other team chose, maybe they accidentally chose people weak to me?  Because I was sym from the start and don't think it was a map that was particularly pro-sym, with the point in a small enclosed area or anything.

I've definitely swapped to sym when dealing with a particularly troublesome genji or rein, but after giving it a while, when we're reaaaaaaaally getting steamrolled and I'm not getting anywhere.

I agree with the people saying mercy lucio. The mercy pretty much has to heal bot for the team to have any sustain.

"927","I can't fucking believe this. Pink from 'Among Us' ruined my marriage.

A couple months ago, my wife said she was going out for a ladies' night. She asked me to take care of my son, so I immediately obliged. ""Yes Ma'am,"" I told her. After a while of waiting, she finally left and I could play my favourite game, Among Us. I hopped on my laptop, booted it up and my desktop loaded, complete with the 'Red Sus' background and all my Among Us Impostor fan-art. I was shaking in excitement. I slowly dragged my finger across the track pad, and watched the cursor as it glided over to the Among Us icon. Among Us. My absolute favourite game of all time and quite possibly the best and most well-made game in the entire world. As I clicked the button my body twitched with joy at the thought of being the impostor again. My fingers drummed impatiently on my desk as the Innersloth logo faded in, and then out. Then the main title appeared. I immediately looked at pink as she slowly floated across the screen. Oh, how I wish I could feel those luscious, soft asscheeks. Pink is my queen. The real woman in my life. My wife could never be as sexy as Pink is; her soft footfalls in electrical as I peek at her curvy form from inside a vent, waiting for the right time to strike. I could never get close to Pink, however, as if she had some kind of sixth sense, she would always leave before I could reveal myself to her as the impostor. I press Practice, to warm up my fingers before my first intense game of Among Us. I hit Blue in Comms, then cross the hall and vent to Specimen, murdering Green in cold blood. The thrill of killing an animated character in an online game has never been such a rush. I then move towards Reactor, stabbing Yellow in the back and then running down the corridor to the right to access Decontamination. I move quietly through the halls, like a snake about to strike its prey, and I see- Oh no. It's Pink. Standing there motionlessly as I face her directly. Her visor shows no emotion. But she knows. I can feel it in the air. I can't kill her. She is too beautiful, too angelic, the light reflecting off of her pink bodysuit, like stars on a voided sky. She doesn't run. I am moved to tears as I caress the screen, kissing it tenderly. ""Goodbye, Pink. See you soon. It will all be okay,"" I whisper in a soft, reassuring voice. Then as my cursor hovers over the kill button, I hesitate. Thoughts of love go through my head. Red having reddish-pink sus children with Pink. But I have to. As the impostor, it is my duty to kill. I press the 'Kill' button and watch as my character beheads Pink silently. All I hear is the spurt of blood. There is no rush. There is only Red, standing by himself in Fuel. Pink's lifeless body laying on the floor beside him. I feel nothing at first, then immense sadness, like I'm at a loved one's funeral. My son knocks on the door, interrupting my brief moment of mourning. He asks, ""Dad? Are you going to make me a snack?"" I tell him to shut up, and my voice cracks. I break down sobbing. I killed her. I killed my one true love. God, forgive me. I open the door to my son, and he has a confused look on his face. I say nothing, and walk to the kitchen to make him a sandwich. Tears roll off my face into the bread as I lay it onto the counter. Lettuce, cheese and meat, followed by a sad swirl of mustard on top. My son is quiet. He sits on the couch, and stares at the floor. There is a depressing air around us. I serve him the sandwich and walk back to my room, contemplating life. If I killed Pink, how am I to be trusted around my family? I cry for hours, and finally my wife comes back. She sees me bawling on the bed like a child who dropped his ice cream. She then asks me why I'm crying and mutter, ""I killed her. I killed my only love, Pink, in Among Us."" She is filled with rage and slaps me across my face. I feel numb. She asks for a divorce. I don't reply. Instead, I take my laptop and get into my car, driving to a nearby hotel. Fast forward a few months to the divorce. It was quick and painless. After court, I ask my former wife to take me back.

""I can't take you back. You've always been this way. I was sus of you from the start.""

"512","Yup wait until the 25th

unless you can remember your gold count you had saved up before stopping and How much Dust you had

then maybe not wait and start farming Gold for the The Heroes of Starcraft Full mini-set 2500G - and maybe 2 of 3 factions 1200G each (Zerg & Terran)

possibly even Golden Full mini-set (12000G) - if u have that much gold

since Nerfs where annoucned and the 4 options above can net you 3760 - 1760 - 2000 - 3760 and 11.2k Dust - unless you want to dust everything or just the Golden set (20k+ Dust)","hearthstone","0","","yup wait until the th

"1181","As an Ana player I feel this post in my bones lol 

Since OW2 I’ve found it significantly more difficult to get a POTG with Nana but this takes the cake, by a mile.

I truly wish that as the game continues to evolve, they’re able to find more impactful ways to communicate what each role offers to the overall gameplay aside from straight stats on the board, cause this was pure cinema that’d have gone unnoticed otherwise.

Great gameplay!","overwatch","0","","as an ana player i feel this post in my bones lol
