"192","I have always thought it would be neat to have a champion that can switch between a magic-damage form and a physical-damage form. Where any AD or AP you buy is just converted into Adaptive Force instead, and converts as needed for each form. The basic identity of this champion would be that it has access to a gigantic variety of items and therefore a ton of versatility.

Like someone like Kayle or Riven (thematic-wise). Who can switch between a melee sword form, or a magic sword form. In the melee form, they fight like a skirmisher with physical damage. In the magical form, they can launch magic waves with their sword and similar thematic spells that deal magic damage.

It would be hard to balance, because it would be difficult for enemies to itemize defensively against.  
But i don't necessarily think it would be impossible. You would just need to make sure they don't have any % damage built into their kit, so that HP is a decent stat that enemies can use to help build defensively if needed against them, and make sure that none of their ratios are absurd so that they can't just nuke people.

Or maybe this champion might not be allowed to switch forms freely. But instead has to choose one permanently similar to Kayn. But they still get all of their AP and AD converted to adaptive force so they have access to basically every item in the game. Because they have access to every item in the game, and two seperate playstyles, it would be a champion that could have potentially dozens of different viable builds and playstyles instead of always just being the same core build/champion every game.","league-of-legends","0","","i have always thought it would be neat to have a champion that can switch between a magicdamage form and a physicaldamage form where any ad or ap you buy is just converted into adaptive force instead and converts as needed for each form the basic identity of this champion would be that it has access to a gigantic variety of items and therefore a ton of versatility

"14","So do you guys know those waterslides that you stand in, and then they suddenly drop you straight down onto the water slide? If not, look them up on YouTube, there's nothing like them.

Ah yes, the sweet memories of my first time on one of these. I feel that my mental/emotional scars have healed enough to tell this gem.

At the time my girlfriend, now Fiancée, worked as a photographer for one of those resorts with the indoor and outdoor water parks. One of her perks was that her and a family member/friend could get into the waterpark for free, so one hot summer day she had off and we both decided it'd be fun to go there and cool down for the day.

While we were there, I discovered one of there most ""Thrilling"" looking waterslides. Basically you stand in this tube, and then the slide operator presses a button and this slide drops you straight down a good 90 FEET, before you actually start going down the water slide. Me, being a thrill seeker, of course had to try it. So I made the great climb up to the top of the slide, stood in line, and finally it was my turn. Once I got in the tube, the operator told me to keep my legs crossed. Now I'm a pretty big heavy guy, so I was like ""That's uncomfortable as fuck, I'm not doing that"". So there I was standing in the tube, having a panic attack from anticipation, with my legs not crossed. The operator finally presses the button, the bottom opens and I fall straight down the water slide. Very quickly I realized why they have you cross your legs. Water shot so far up my ass, so fast, I swear I tasted it in my mouth. My body raced down that slide, as I questioned every life choice that I have ever made.

Once I made it to the bottom, I sat there for a moment, absolutely violated. I felt like someone in an episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. I built up the courage to finally stand up, and all I could feel was the nice warm stream of water mixed with shit, and maybe a little bit of blood shoot out of my ass faster than the Steamboat Geyser at Yellowstone National Park. I quickly got off the slide and ran to the bathroom, with a trail of shitty water tailing me as the slide operator stared in awe. They had to shut down the slide for the rest of the day :'), but man was my asshole clean after that!

"238","To me, the most fun aspect of drafting by far is adaptation.

Oh we got stomped by the standard first pick in the first game? Can we ban out 2 characters that usually have high synergy with them and then let them through? Or are we forced to ban them? What if we leave a permaban open so our opponent's have to chose between giving us the permaban or what they just stomped us with?

This is also true on a macrolevel: It is a lot of fun to me to follow the meta over the entire tournament. Last worlds Yone/Aurora were THE two picks. But then Skarner started to become more and more of a concern as well, is giving Yone if it means getting Skarner (and having a target ban more) worth it? Jax and Ashe are two other picks that changed over the tournament and it was a lot of fun to follow.

Another part that is disappointing to me is that draft is just harder to follow. Sure, the interactions between characters is not different, but there are more moving pieces to keep track of and it just isn't as possible to follow a draft and understand what is being setup for with every ban unless you are absolutely cracked.

Is the larger variety in game worth that? Maybe, depends on what you like, but the actual drafting phase is just providing less for an invested fan.","league-of-legends","0","","to me the most fun aspect of drafting by far is adaptation

"194","I would love a version of hextech gunblade from TFT. It basically heals both the user and the lowest nearby ally as omnivamp from the owner's damage. It's kinda like the knight vow effect but this is an item the damage dealer is buying to make his front line get more durable and both of them heal not just 1.

Ability to reduce enemy ability haste and casting speed/projectiles. It's more like a magic resist frozen heart/nasus W. And yes AS increases the basic attack animation speed this is why i went for casting speed too.

AP thornmail that hurts ability users for attacking them. This can be an item or ability like rammus W.

Magnetic field that sucks all skillshots to certain point. It can be like wind wall but the targeted projectiles must find a target after that, so they will go back to the caster or continue to reach the original target depending on the distance or other rules.

A bard (not like the one we have but an actual one that plays a flute or other instruments) who can combo like hwei. He gets 10 abilities too using the QQ, QW, QE, etc mechanic. He gives wide variety of effects like % damage  amp, AD boost, AP boost, AS boost, AH boost, MS boost, heal and mana restore, shield, slowing zone (like a 600 units randuin omen slow active), a split second AOE fear like vex W+P. This is not all ofc as you can play 2 notes at the same time like AP+ damage amp note together or heal+shield notes together. Range is like seraphine W to act as the heart of the team like bards usually do in D&D games. And R is not a simple ultimate ofc. It will be a queue for notes to play one after another (3/5/7 based R on level) as you can prepare it like unsealed spell book or by other means like holding R instead of tapping it to arrange the order. These notes are stronger and can use the same note over and over and over for the entire duration of the ultimate.

"1286","I think the biggest thing about console is having a sens you can actually control. No reason to have a sens that allows you to do 180s of you can't hit your shots consistently. The ""ideal"" sens is probably like 100 100 with 0 aim smoothing but I only know a handful of people who can actually use it and they're all high gm. Even some of the champ dps don't use it cause it's really hard to control + you basically can only flick. 

Some settings to definitely tune/turn off is aim ease in, aim assist ease in, aim assist window size, and aim smoothing. 

Aim ease in messes you up a ton. It's a exponential ramp on your aim which hinders your ability to react to things quickly. I keep this at 0 since I like my sticks actually moving when I want them to. 

Aim assist ease in is also weird. It kind of magnetizes your crosshair onto a person so you can't switch targets easily. I have this at 0 cause you have a hard time switching targets with this on. 

Aim assist window size is in a similar vein to aim assist ease in. Window size by default is probably like half your screen (haven't really tested), but it's the area in which aim assist is going to be active in. If you have it at max it moves even when you aren't aiming at them. I keep it at 15 but you can change it depending on how good your raw aim is. 

Aim smoothing is what the name is and it ""smooths"" your aim. So instead of it going from point A to point B basically immediately, it smooths the process and slows it down as well. If you want very flicky aim you turn this down a bunch. I keep it around 50 which makes it possible to do flicks but also low enough that I can track pretty effectively. I think 70-80 would be better for pure tracking kind of aim. 

Another setting I wanna touch on is the aim techniques, which are dual-zone, exponential, and linear. 
This comes down to preference but I like dual a lot. Let's me have a low sens to track with and a high sens for doing 180s.
Exponential is also pretty good for tracking, but you can't really do instantaneous 180s since it takes a second to ramp up. 
Linear is the ""ideal"" sens since it's basically a 1:1 input to output, but you're stuck with a single sens so you kinda need to choose between tracking and flicking. 

A few other things I wanna touch on

First is controlling your stick. If you're struggling to track you might be pushing the stick all the way too much. You need to be able to use pretty fine movements to aim effectively. If you can't do this, go for a lower sens, higher aim smoothing, with linear. 

Next is practicing your raw aim. Go into training range and to the shooting area. Go for bullseye, 10 or 20m, and stationary with cassidy and any flicking character is guess for flicking practice. And bots, 10m, and player strafe with zarya for tracking. You don't have any aim assist so dial in your settings here. 

After you get it dialed in you kind of need to learn how to play with aim assist. Learning to let it influence your aim while tracking is pretty important. Especially in a close range 1v1 the aim assist should be doing the majority of the aiming. You can practice this in game or things like against bots. 

And probably the most important thing that people don't realize is that movement is half your aim. Whatever movement you take influences your aim as well, so you need to pay attention to it. A lot of people do crazy random movement they don't think about while in a stressful situation and that means you're literally compensating for your random movement while trying to hit them. Especially on console you can go for bigger left to right strafes. Just keep mind of your movement while aiming and it should help a lot. 

Btw if you wanna use my setting as reference:

Off","overwatch","0","","i think the biggest thing about console is having a sens you can actually control no reason to have a sens that allows you to do s of you cant hit your shots consistently the ideal sens is probably like   with  aim smoothing but i only know a handful of people who can actually use it and theyre all high gm even some of the champ dps dont use it cause its really hard to control  you basically can only flick 

some settings to definitely tuneturn off is aim ease in aim assist ease in aim assist window size and aim smoothing 

aim ease in messes you up a ton its a exponential ramp on your aim which hinders your ability to react to things quickly i keep this at  since i like my sticks actually moving when i want them to 

aim assist ease in is also weird it kind of magnetizes your crosshair onto a person so you cant switch targets easily i have this at  cause you have a hard time switching targets with this on 

aim assist window size is in a similar vein to aim assist ease in window size by default is probably like half your screen havent really tested but its the area in which aim assist is going to be active in if you have it at max it moves even when you arent aiming at them i keep it at  but you can change it depending on how good your raw aim is 

aim smoothing is what the name is and it smooths your aim so instead of it going from point a to point b basically immediately it smooths the process and slows it down as well if you want very flicky aim you turn this down a bunch i keep it around  which makes it possible to do flicks but also low enough that i can track pretty effectively i think  would be better for pure tracking kind of aim 

another setting i wanna touch on is the aim techniques which are dualzone exponential and linear 
this comes down to preference but i like dual a lot lets me have a low sens to track with and a high sens for doing s
exponential is also pretty good for tracking but you cant really do instantaneous s since it takes a second to ramp up 
linear is the ideal sens since its basically a  input to output but youre stuck with a single sens so you kinda need to choose between tracking and flicking 

a few other things i wanna touch on

first is controlling your stick if youre struggling to track you might be pushing the stick all the way too much you need to be able to use pretty fine movements to aim effectively if you cant do this go for a lower sens higher aim smoothing with linear 

next is practicing your raw aim go into training range and to the shooting area go for bullseye  or m and stationary with cassidy and any flicking character is guess for flicking practice and bots m and player strafe with zarya for tracking you dont have any aim assist so dial in your settings here 

after you get it dialed in you kind of need to learn how to play with aim assist learning to let it influence your aim while tracking is pretty important especially in a close range v the aim assist should be doing the majority of the aiming you can practice this in game or things like against bots 

and probably the most important thing that people dont realize is that movement is half your aim whatever movement you take influences your aim as well so you need to pay attention to it a lot of people do crazy random movement they dont think about while in a stressful situation and that means youre literally compensating for your random movement while trying to hit them especially on console you can go for bigger left to right strafes just keep mind of your movement while aiming and it should help a lot 

btw if you wanna use my setting as reference

"395","Interesting thought but I honestly don't think it helps those projailed champions because if something is really strong in competitive, then it would probably be permabanned with neither team playing it at all, pretty much just taking away 1 ban slot from red side team.

"49","I have lost everything, and I'm not sure how to continue. This summer I invested $17,500 (six months salary and my entire life savings) into ornamental gourd futures, hoping to capitalize on this lucrative emerging industry. After watching a video about Vincent Kosuga and his monopoly on onions, I decided I'd try to do something similar with another vegetable. I did some research and found out many agricultural forecasters expected this year's gourd yield would be far smaller than the past, due to deteriorating soil conditions in central Mexico and a warmer-than-average spring. At first, demand soared around Halloween and prices skyrocketed, but the gourd bubble burst on November 12th. Unfortunately, the coronavirus caused a massive drop-off in demand due to fewer families decorating their tables for thanksgiving, and prices plummeted. I had invested early enough that I thought I would still be fine, but then on the morning of December 2nd, a new email in my inbox caused my stomach to turn into a pretzel. The massive gourd shipment from Argentina, scheduled for early March, had arrived. I was planning on selling off my futures right before this, in February, but this ruined everything. To top it off, the gourds in this shipment were absolutely gargantuan, some topping 4 pounds each, causing the price-per-pound to drop like an anchor into the range of 6 cents per pound. I am ruined.","classic","1","0.0284900284900284","i have lost everything and im not sure how to continue this summer i invested  six months salary and my entire life savings into ornamental gourd futures hoping to capitalize on this lucrative emerging industry after watching a video about vincent kosuga and his monopoly on onions i decided id try to do something similar with another vegetable i did some research and found out many agricultural forecasters expected this years gourd yield would be far smaller than the past due to deteriorating soil conditions in central mexico and a warmerthanaverage spring at first demand soared around halloween and prices skyrocketed but the gourd bubble burst on november th unfortunately the coronavirus caused a massive dropoff in demand due to fewer families decorating their tables for thanksgiving and prices plummeted i had invested early enough that i thought i would still be fine but then on the morning of december nd a new email in my inbox caused my stomach to turn into a pretzel the massive gourd shipment from argentina scheduled for early march had arrived i was planning on selling off my futures right before this in february but this ruined everything to top it off the gourds in this shipment were absolutely gargantuan some topping  pounds each causing the priceperpound to drop like an anchor into the range of  cents per pound i am ruined"

He remembers the smell of Brooklyn's cigarettes like nothing else. He always kept a pack of Lucky's with him. The boys are gone, now. He knows that; it's just that he forgets, sometimes.

You try to pinch your butt closed but that makes your insides hurt. The poop accelerates. You call 911. The paramedics call for doctors. The doctors call for specialists. The story trends on Twitter. You turn down talk show appearances. Your septic tank fails. People form a cult. Your toilet is finished. Volunteers arrive with buckets and shovels. You are completely used to the smell. The poop accelerates. You are moved to a stepladder with a hole in the top step. The poop accelerates. The shovelers abandon the buckets and shovel directly out the window. The poop accelerates.

"281","A few plausible theories:

1) They’re smarter than they seem. They’re testing consumer reaction. “Test balloons” as u/Rock-swarm put it. Seemingly haphazardly announcing bad decisions but actually carefully planned large scale AB testing. 
2) They’re smarter than they seem. They have a detailed sense of what generates value and what doesn’t and ultimately they don’t really care. They’re willing to slowly nuke Esports or Clash or anything else because players who care about A generate X% less revenue than players who care about B and we’ve got enough Bs and they’re easier to satisfy. We don’t know what percent of the top spending players make up what percent of their total revenue but it could be that most Reddit complaints just don’t matter. 

1 and 2 can also be part of shifting the goal posts. Memory is short and attention is shorter and they might just be willing to sacrifice blips of bad sentiment to move away from doing things that are less profitable. 

3) They’re grossly incompetent. 

It’s probably somewhere in the middle. But I think I kind of hope it’s a mix and if it has to be one, I hope it’s the third. 

I do love your emphasis on QA and the class project analogy is very interesting. My running joke is to suggest an intern did it (sorry interns! I was one once too, so I get it). When the stats that would come on screen during LCS last season were just nonsense, it preserves the most hope to assume a poor intern did it with very little time or resources. 

The First Stand HUD is an interesting case to consider. Is it

1 or 2) More mobile friendly? Requires more active prolonged attention? Etc? 
3) The HUD UI team suck at their jobs/are under resourced.

It’s hard to understand why Riot just gets things wrong. Be better. You have tons of money to play with. Why do different regions have different formats and HUDs and all this. Just figure out what’s best, and do it. You’d get more economies of scale from not doing it 20 different ways anyways! Ugh","league-of-legends","0","","a few plausible theories

"18","""touch grass"" is not an insult towards gamers, rather it is advice for them. When participating in intense periods of gaming, the human hand has a tendency to get sweaty. The sweat causes the hand to become slick, and it b becomes more difficult to retain a grip on the gamers gaming mouse, thus making it more difficult to perform well in intense gaming moments. By touching grass with the gamers hand, the grass will impart a layer of particulate onto the gamers hand, the particulate can be made of a variety of dusts, dirts and other natural matter. This particulate will then act in a similar form to climbers chalk, absorbing the sweat and drying out the gamers hand. With dry hands, the gamer can now perform to their maximum when gaming. This is why when an enemy or teammate tells you to touch grass, they are simply trying to assist you in performing better.","classic","1","0.0218894009216589","touch grass is not an insult towards gamers rather it is advice for them when participating in intense periods of gaming the human hand has a tendency to get sweaty the sweat causes the hand to become slick and it b becomes more difficult to retain a grip on the gamers gaming mouse thus making it more difficult to perform well in intense gaming moments by touching grass with the gamers hand the grass will impart a layer of particulate onto the gamers hand the particulate can be made of a variety of dusts dirts and other natural matter this particulate will then act in a similar form to climbers chalk absorbing the sweat and drying out the gamers hand with dry hands the gamer can now perform to their maximum when gaming this is why when an enemy or teammate tells you to touch grass they are simply trying to assist you in performing better"

"59","Do british people actually exist? I mean, they must be a meme, there is a not a single thing about them. And I mean it.

Let's go through the evidence: Where are they from? Not a single country in the world is named Britain. Some people say they come from England, and England is inside Britain, but if that was the case they would be British they would be Englanders. Also, heard some silly theories about them coming from whales. Guys, no, whale people do not exist. Whales live in the sea.

There is a consensus on British people coming from Europe, but then we are left with a whole continent of possible locations. That's as good as nothing. What do they eat? Every country has at least one main dish. Even the US has their burgers. But these British people, what do they eat? Heard some people associating them with tea, but everyone knows that's an Asian thing. Shouldn't they come from Europe? One of these two points must be wrong them. To me, it looks too sketchy.

What language do they speak? I challenge you, putting all my money and my ass on the line here, to find a supposed """"British"""" person speaking their native language. Most of then just speak a broken ENGLISH. Yes, english. Really suspicious, huh? And I even tried to look deeper into it. Maybe british just SOUND like english, just like spanish could sound like portuguese for a non-speaker.

what language do they speak i challenge you putting all my money and my ass on the line here to find a supposed british person speaking their native language most of then just speak a broken english yes english really suspicious huh and i even tried to look deeper into it maybe british just sound like english just like spanish could sound like portuguese for a nonspeaker so i looked up british dictionary on google and what i found was shocking every word in there was american i kid you not what this could mean is beyond my capabilities but i can safely assure you that british people do not exist "

"1256","Video Game developers, animators and artists talk about this quite abit. It’s a very well known phenomenon in modern media - where there’s a comparatively tiny group of Female face archetypes, especially within a given ethnicity that people in this sphere find attractive. If an artist deviates too heavily, it will get labelled as “ugly”.

You see this effect in full swing with a particularly vocal minority in the gaming audience. You know the ones. The people who think Aloy or Ciri are “too masculine” for having the audacity to have a realistic jaw line, lip shape, or build. There’s a reason *thousands of Anime characters* have *exactly* the same face shape - because that’s what people *expect* for “attractive” characters.

Blizzard, to their credit, have actually pushed the envelope further than many developers - and have been very successful too. Not only do you have a wide range of ethnicities in the cast, but they’ve broadened the physique into areas less tread. Zarya for example with her strong jaw line and rectangular face shape is a massive departure from traditional female faces in video games.

But unfortunately, when it comes to “lithe white woman”, they’re going to struggle for variety. Once you remove the Hair, skin and Eye colour from a female face, the parameters you can safely play with in a video game are minimal, without pushback from the audience. Especially with a stylised art-style like Overwatch.

Right or wrong, it’s just the reality of the situation. So I don’t blame Blizzard for Freyja looking like Widow/Brig. I challenge anyone to make a *truly distinct* face for Freyja that still comes across as “attractive”.","overwatch","0","","video game developers animators and artists talk about this quite abit it’s a very well known phenomenon in modern media  where there’s a comparatively tiny group of female face archetypes especially within a given ethnicity that people in this sphere find attractive if an artist deviates too heavily it will get labelled as “ugly”

Let's do a simple thought experiment: imagine us two standing in front of each other. I, of course, am wearing a pair of jeans, that are covering my genitals and my butt. You then command me to ""go fuck myself"". I may be fucking myself already. I may as well not be fucking myself already. Until my dick and its position relative to my ass is observed, it is simultaneously in my ass, but also outside of it - thus, it stays in superposition. The moment you lay eyes on my penis, both states collide with each other and become either one. You may have already guessed what the problem here is. As soon as a single photon reflected by my dick enters either one of your eyes, you become gay. The only way to avoid this is to not observe my penis. But if you don't look at it, then you will never know if your insult had any effect, thus rendering it meaningless. Since you have already made the insult, you are now, too, in superposition - you're either wrong, or gay. It's unfortunate, really - you dug a hole for yourself without even knowing it.

Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.

As someone who is a scientist who studies crows, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls jackdaws crows. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.

If you're saying ""crow family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens.

So your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people ""call the black ones crows?"" Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too.

Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family. But that's not what you said. You said a jackdaw is a crow, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the crow family crows, which means you'd call blue jays, ravens, and other birds crows, too.

triple frost DK (budget) -> double frost unholy (adding legendaries like helya) -> starship/rainbow control DK -> starship rogue -> cycle rogue (rip my beloved). most of the time i played a cheap solid deck and gradually added legendaries. sometimes i got greedy and disenchanted other decks but i feel like it paid off for me in enjoyment 

the other thing you should focus on imo is the sheer amount of free stuff you can get. do your quests, collect the free packs for the expansion, do tavern brawls etc. it’ll take about 2 expansions but you do it all f2p 

furthermore we’re close to rotation meaning the card pool is gonna shrink significantly making it the perfect timing to start growing your collection","hearthstone","0","","i think you’re in a tough spot just because the expansion is right around the corner and we don’t know which decks will be good or not i don’t mind you dusting dh even though it might have been hasty as a fp you’re gonna have to plan how you use your resources for example the upcoming into the emerald dream has neutral imbue cards and neutral dark gift cards since those are the probable arche types of this expansion they have higher priority like the star craft for multiple factions for example the other advice i can give you is not to disenchant classes you don’t like but rather focus on your fav class first

"394","True, but you are forgetting the bans. If a champ is so OP, he might get banned in all games and still creates the same problem. Less likely to happen, but we had Skarner just now as an example.

You won't see Riot nerfing champs because of a 80+% presence in pro play, but because of a 60+% presence now.

Yone has a 68% presence in last stand and is likely on Riots watch list for pro play nerfs but in soloQ his WR is around 47.5-48% only. He will for sure see no buffs in this state due to pro play.

Another example is KSante. Even with recent nerfs he still shows up strong enough for pro play to take a high spot. No buffs for him, but maybe more nerfs.

Kalista, too.

Riot won't have to move as quickly as in the past to deal with large outliners, but the problem isn't removed, it just impacts the viewers less.","league-of-legends","0","","true but you are forgetting the bans if a champ is so op he might get banned in all games and still creates the same problem less likely to happen but we had skarner just now as an example

As far as actual advice, the Power Flowers are incredibly important, as is knowing when to run away through a Hexgate. Which map you're on, who you're fighting, it all sorta adds up and the only way to get better is to keep at it!

It also helps to remember your champ and play accordingly.

"1","I like to creep around my home and act like a goblin

I don’t know why but I just enjoy doing this. Maybe it’s my way of dealing with stress or something but I just do it about once every week. Generally I’ll carry around a sack and creep around in a sort of crouch-walking position making goblin noises, then I’ll walk around my house and pick up various different “trinkets” and put them in my bag while saying stuff like “I’ll be having that” and laughing maniacally in my goblin voice (“trinkets” can include anything from shit I find on the ground to cutlery or other utensils). The other day I was talking with my neighbours and they mentioned hearing weird noises like what I wrote about and I was just internally screaming the entire conversation.

# FAQ

## What does this mean?

The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.

## Why did you do this?

There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:

• ⁠Rudeness towards other Redditors, • ⁠Spreading incorrect information, • ⁠Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.

## Am I banned from the Reddit?

No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.

## I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?

Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.

## How can I prevent this from happening in the future?

Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.","classic","1","0.0621345029239766","i just downvoted your comment

"961","So yesterday at lunch, I was about to eat with my friends from band when I realized that there was an empty seat at a table with some of the popular kids. I decided to take advantage of this opportunity to troll them, and perhaps befriend some of them. I sat at their table, and right as I sat down, I noticed that one of the kids (who happened to be black) was sitting above a vent. I yelled ""Black is sus! He's on top of a vent!!"" Everyone at the table looked up at me, but no one laughed (they probably didn't get the reference). I decided that I would try to get them to be familiar with it, so I asked ""Do to guys wanna play some Among Us???"" They were all dead silent (honestly they just didn't know how fun of a game it was). I slapped the middle of our table (to mimick the ""emergency meeting"" feature in Among Us), and I screamed ""EMERGENCY MEETING!!!"" Again, none of them laughed. One of them looked at me and said ""Can you please sit somewhere else?"" At this point, I realized that I had to make them laugh quickly, or I would blow my chance with them. I made the widest grin I could possibly make (Trying to mimick the ""When the imposter is sus"" meme) and I said ""When the impoter is sus"". I then tried to make a face that resembled the ""Flushed"" emoji (as part of the meme). However, I don't think any of them understood the reference. I then pulled up the among us theme song on Youtube and played it on full blast. At this point, everyone at my table was asking for me to leave, and their friend came back, who regularly sat in the chair I was sitting in. I went back to sit with my friends from band. However, I will forever remember the time I trolled ALL of the popular kids in my grade.","among-us","1","0.0416422287390029","so yesterday at lunch i was about to eat with my friends from band when i realized that there was an empty seat at a table with some of the popular kids i decided to take advantage of this opportunity to troll them and perhaps befriend some of them i sat at their table and right as i sat down i noticed that one of the kids who happened to be black was sitting above a vent i yelled black is sus hes on top of a vent everyone at the table looked up at me but no one laughed they probably didnt get the reference i decided that i would try to get them to be familiar with it so i asked do to guys wanna play some among us they were all dead silent honestly they just didnt know how fun of a game it was i slapped the middle of our table to mimick the emergency meeting feature in among us and i screamed emergency meeting again none of them laughed one of them looked at me and said can you please sit somewhere else at this point i realized that i had to make them laugh quickly or i would blow my chance with them i made the widest grin i could possibly make trying to mimick the when the imposter is sus meme and i said when the impoter is sus i then tried to make a face that resembled the flushed emoji as part of the meme however i dont think any of them understood the reference i then pulled up the among us theme song on youtube and played it on full blast at this point everyone at my table was asking for me to leave and their friend came back who regularly sat in the chair i was sitting in i went back to sit with my friends from band however i will forever remember the time i trolled all of the popular kids in my grade"

"520","I think if we look at the expansion in a vacuum, it's a great card in a slow meta (aka what the cards are promoting this expansion). However, Turn 8 is just very late into the game when looking at it through the lens of standard. For that reason, this seems like a weak, but very fun card. 

I would've liked to see Malorne be 7 Mana, but maybe lower its stats a bit as balance, that way you can have a powerful turn 8. Turn 8 is roughly how long games in HS have lasted on average throughout its life cycle. So I would've liked to see Malorne at 7 to make it more likely that it sees play in more games. 

Imbue as a whole seems like it's geared towards slower games, so maybe the decks are going to be well equipped enough as is to allow Malorne to see play.","hearthstone","0","","i think if we look at the expansion in a vacuum its a great card in a slow meta aka what the cards are promoting this expansion however turn  is just very late into the game when looking at it through the lens of standard for that reason this seems like a weak but very fun card

"1187","Leading up to OW1's launch it was mostly just cause it was the hot new game that all my friends were hyped for.  I'd never played any other Blizzard games at the time (Or TF2, which was obviously the biggest comparison it had), but Overwatch had fantastic character/map designs that clearly appealed to more than just Blizzard fans, so I tried the beta and fell in love with it.

Nowadays, I still play it because it's one of the few big multiplayer games that doesn't feel like it's weighed down by a bunch of unnecessary garbage.  There isn't a bunch of extra shit tacked on taking away from the core of the game (Which is one of the reasons I stopped playing Fortnite and CoD), collaborations feel like they're actually curated for the game and not just thrown in at random, etc.

People clowned on OW2 for barely being a sequel, but I'm kind of *glad* they didn't go too far with it.  Sure the way PvE turned out is disappointing, but on the multiplayer side of things, I'm glad it still mostly feels the same as it did in OW1.

We took our seats and the priest was up front talking about ""salvation"" and ""holiness"" or whatever. Same thing as last week.

But then, he said something that really caught me off guard. He spoke of a man who goes by the name of ""Jesus.""

""Jesus.""

""JeSUS.""

No way. I could not believe what I was hearing.

Endorphins were rushing to my brain and my body began to shiver as I let out a quiet moan.

If you didn't catch on by now, the word ""Jesus"" has ""SUS"" in it, which is a reference to the popular video game ""Among Us.""

""WHEN THE IMPOSTER IS SUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!""

I screamed louder than I ever have in my life. My words echoed throughout the room for five seconds before fading into complete silence.

Everyone was staring at me as I had a huge grin on my face, perfectly replicating the face from the ""when the imposter is sus"" meme (Google it if you don't know what it is.)

They all had this look on their faces as if I had just slaughtered 7,924 Afghanian children.

""Why do you all have that look on your faces? Did someone do a Fortnite dance?""

And there was still complete silence. I actually had to make sure I wasn't wearing my noise cancelling headphones that I always wear while playing Among Us. I could not believe that not one person in the room was dying of laughter!!

""Young man, please be quiet"" said the priest.

He was literally the one who made the Among Us reference in the first place. What's his problem?

""THAT'S NOT VERY WHOLESOME!!!!!!!!!!""

This guy was definitely the imposter. There's no way he couldn't be.

I Naruto ran faster than anyone has ever Naruto ran before. Even Naruto himself would be proud of me.

As I was making my way up to the imposter, the security guard was chasing after me!

I had to think fast.

After being chased around the room for two minutes, I hastily undid my pants and peed in the security guard's eyes. As he was being blinded by my pee, he was stumbling around and bumped into the wall very hard.

A crucifix fell off the wall and impaled his stupid, ugly fat head. He fell and a pool of blood soon formed around him.

Everyone in the church was screaming and running out the door. I slammed my hand down on the crucifix, replicating the button you press in Among Us, which drove the crucifix further into his skull.

""EMERGENCY MEETING!!!!!!!!!!!""

No one laughed. They were too busy screaming to notice. Whatever.

I stripped completely naked and went up to the priest. I replicated the Big Chungus pose with 100% accuracy.

""You probably don't even use Reddit. That's not very keanu chungus wholesome 100 of you. Go subscribe to r/atheism.""

The priest had a look of shock on his face when I said that. The kind of face one would make if they caught their beloved child playing Fortnite.

He held a cross in front of himself and started talking about ""possession"" and ""demons."" He obviously doesn't know how to play Among Us so naturally, I felt bad for him.

But he was still the imposter.

I grabbed him and threw him across the church, sending him crashing through the window and slammed against the street outside. A car ran over his head, causing his brain and skull fragments to splatter everywhere.

Then, I heard sirens and a helicopter flying around above the church. I went upstairs to the roof to check out what was going on.

""This is the police! Get down from the roof now or we will shoot!""

This guy is so sus, let me tell ya.

Obviously, I was not going to listen to an imposter so I was Naruto running around the roof. Bullets from the helicopter were raining down from above but none of them hit me since I was Naruto running so fast.

""Dammit, I can't hit him!""

I knew I had him beat then.

So, I pulled out my gun (I always keep a glock in my foreskin so I can pull the Among Us death animation when I lose my virginity because I know it makes girls horny.)

I shot at the helicopter and it started spinning out of control and crashed into the front of the church, causing a huge explosion.

The roof started sliding off from the building, which landed on the cop cars and killed 8 cops. This also flung me into the street and I broke my foot, which was very sus.

I limped all the way to the woods where I am now hiding and writing this. I will update as soon as I can but I need to get out of here soon because I can hear people looking for me.","among-us","1","0.0607685433422698","so last sunday my parents made me go to church which made me really mad because my parents dont let me play among us in church

"1231","I like the concept of ball spinning on the ground to instantly gain fireball but I think losing piledrive is way too much, damage output would feel really low (and I would fall off the map being unable to use the recovery piledrive lol). You would have 2 defensive cooldowns with not a lot of offensive pressure.

Instead piledrive could function on the ground to spin in place for a second (with maugas charge properties) and get fireball speed into one direction. This perk would share the cooldown with piledrive, but allows you to flex the playstyle (do you engage or just disrupt?) and play into some of balls counters without losing your mind at the cost of having less damage output

"50","You fucked up kid. As I type this I have my modded PS2 running a track IP script on your post. Once I have triangulated your position in the world, my PS3 will release to your router my very own Pandora box virus. You won't notice it at first, but soon your lame PC will begin to work against you in ways you can't even imagine. First your graphics card will start to emit the flu virus, your ram will be uploaded online so everyone will be able to use it, your motherboard will slowly secrete acidic resin which will fry the electronics.

"546","Ask yourself what is your strongest class? Then go to HSreplay and check arena for how does winrate look there. Pick it accordingly

Don't get obsessed with legendary synergy while drafting.   
Check stats with tools like firestone or hsreplays site (cards tab)  
Draft a faster deck (lower curve) rather than slower (also take prio card draw)  
Make sure you have early game and keep pushing

Think tempo plays as much as you can, usually thats the way. Don't go face only, don't trade only, consider why you trade (if you get a free trade).   
Classes like Paladin, Shaman, Mage, Druid, Priest, Warrior have heavy healing possitblites, so you might get trapped if you go face and think you only win by that.

Think what you can do this turn together with what your plan is next turn.  
Get help from tools like firestone to keep track of cards that you know for sure are in their hand, and play around them.  
Value 4 HP+ on minions on the board.

"763","Generally speaking, it's a good idea to buy 10 packs from any expansion because you are guaranteed your first legendary from that set within the first 10 packs. You could save some gold by doing this piecemeal, too, until you get your first legendary and then move along to another expansion.

Assuming you intend to play standard, the Festival of Legends, TITANS, and Showdown in the Badlands expansions rotate out of standard next week (25/3) so they are not worth investing in if you intend to focus on standard. However, if you just want to get some dust for crafting other cards, you could try the piecemeal approach until you get your first legendary from those expansions and dust what you open.

The expansions that will remain in standard after 25 March are Whizbang's Workshop, Perils in Paradise, The Great Dark Beyond, and the upcoming (25/3) release of Into the Emerald Dream. Assuming standard is your focus, those are the expansions worth investing more of your resources in. According to Hearthstone Mathematics' data, the Whizbang and Perils sets have been the most influential in terms of power-level, but it's difficult to tell how influential they will remain once Emerald Dream releases. Pre-order bundles are a great opportunity to stockpile cards and dust––that is the best value Hearthstone offers. If you don't want either the $80 or $50 options, there is usually a $20 option after the expansion releases which includes 20 packs and 2 guaranteed legendaries.

Lastly, if you have 2,500G on your account and are in need of dust, the Starcraft mini-set will be receiving significant nerfs and for two weeks afterwards the nerfed cards will refund full dust value. So, if you just want dust to craft the cards that most interest you, that's also a worthwhile investment. Regarding the two mini-sets from the other two expansions remaining in standard, it is only worth buying a mini-set that contains legendaries or epics in decks you actually want to play. ""Traveling Travel Agency"" and ""Dr Boom's"" mini-sets contain cards that see play in some decks but typically restricted (in terms of efficacy) to a few classes (e.g., Druid, DK). If you don't play those classes, don't bother; if you'd like to, it's worth getting the respective mini-sets.

Other than that, I'd recommend perusing [hsguru.com](http://hsguru.com), [hearthstonetopdecks.com](http://hearthstonetopdecks.com), or [hsreplay.net](http://hsreplay.net) to target decks and cards that interest you most.

You work at the drive thru for Mickey D's and found out that the burgers are made of human meat? Priced in. You think insiders don't already know that? The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth.

i think when they plan the next year of expansion they just put it on paper, they put the idea down, they write down a napkin, basically just get the whole concept, maybe even abilities up while they are working on this year expansion, so my guess is that back late 2023-early 2024, when the expansion was being visualized, they did not have the ability to play test it, so they just assumed the mechanic wouldn't cause any problem, flashback to late 2024-early 2025 and as the dev are putting the emerald dream into actual code they realize ""oh, oh fuck no, no we can't have this interaction"" and changed it

  
is this a error from the team? absolutely, i think their process most likely puts it that next year expansion are put on paper and then only began to put into actual mechanics when they finishing the last expansion or miniset of the year, it absolutely not a clean execution and i think it might have been worth just going for a different way of doing the priest imbue power than basically  making raza the unsealed be raza the warsong comander","hearthstone","0","","now if i may put my conspiracy hat on for a second

"434","If you are winning lane and still unable to climb out of bronze as ADC, its because you are missing a lot of fundamentals on ADC and are probably making a ton of mistakes that you don't realize.

Especially on Ashe, Jax should never be reaching you. And Warwick's only chance to get to you should be when he ults.

It doesn't matter that your Malphite went full AP. He still engages hard, and its low elo so to be honest he probably is going to be more useful as AP than tank because nobody is going to respect his burst engage or build items to counter it, nor be capable of flashing it.  
You think if Malphite built tank, that would suddenly make Warwick and Jax stop running at you and instead randomly decide to beat on Malphite? Wrong.

There could be a dozen other things holding you back as well. Maybe your CSing is bad. Your kiting ability is almost certainly bad, because decent kiting ability is enough to get you out of bronze alone on Ashe even if everything else is bad.  
I would bet money that if you go watch some of your replays, you are almost certainly walking into melee range instead of walking AWAY from the enemy as you attack. I see it all the time, even in Gold.

It doesn't matter how often you get bad teammates.  
There is literally an equal chance for the enemy team to get just as bad teammates.  
If you play 100 games, thats 900 different players you have played with. 400 of them on your team, 500 on the enemy teams. If half of those players are horrendously bad, that means 200 of your teammates were really bad, and 250 of your enemies were really bad. So mathematically, you should be running into more bad enemies than allies. The only exception is.... if you are bad, then you are flipping that math the other way around.  
As long as you are not the weak link on your team, you should be at least climbing out of Bronze and Silver.

You will never be able to climb until you accept the raw fact that you have problems you need to work on, and begin working on them. You can complain about teammates for the next 5 years and its going to get you nowhere. On the other hand, checking every single game to make sure you are CSing more than the enemy ADC. Checking one replay after every session to watch a few of your deaths and see if you are walking into melee range or properly kiting. Spending time in the practice tool learning A > Left Click > Right Click to attack and move at the same time smoothly without errors.  
You will not just randomly get better at many of these skills by just playing more and more and more. You need to be honest with yourself, stop being egotistical, and put in the effort to grow these skills one at a time, and more.

You are always going to run into some games that are impossible to win because of teammates. But there is a similar amount of games you will run into where its a free win and you barely need to try.  
These games don't matter. The reason you are stuck in Bronze is because the games that could go either way are going bad more consistently. And the only consistent thing between all of your games: Is you.","league-of-legends","0","","if you are winning lane and still unable to climb out of bronze as adc its because you are missing a lot of fundamentals on adc and are probably making a ton of mistakes that you dont realize

"37","I saw JPOW at the grocery store. I was buying a dozen eggs last night and the store was kind of slow since it was after dark. Some old boomer was in front of me and chatting away with the woman at the cash register. Everyone had masks on, but as soon as he spoke I recognized the voice. He was telling the lady how inflation is a good thing. She said how come inflation keeps going up but minimum wage never rises? He ignored her and pulls out a large sheet of $1 bills. He asks if she had scissors but she said no.

He looked back at me and saw the eggs and said ""You workout huh? Its good to stay healthy. I used to workout by lifting bales of hay after school in 1952. Eggs are a good source of energy, mind if I take one? "" I shrugged and told him.go ahead. He opened my pack of eggs, takes one out, lowers his mask, just throws the whole thing in his mouth shell and all, puts his mask back up, and begins chewing loudly. As he's chewing he's crookedly folding and ripping a sheet of dollar bills handing them to the lady individually. While he's chewing he tells me it's a great time to buy bonds. I tell him I'm good.

The store was short on change so he just pays the full dollar amount. He hands me a crooked bill that is almost ripped in half and says ""thanks pal, in the future that single egg will be worth a dollar so we will call it even""

Im heading to my car after and I see him and another boomer arguing. There was JPOW and he's arguing with a man built like a gnome wearing a poorly fit collared shirt. The little man spoke and I instantly knew it was Cramer. Cramer wanted JPOW to hurry up and stop hogging the best parking spot. JPOW tells Cramer that hes got his mask on inside out and upside down. They both start talking about inflation and then look deep into each other's eyes and start making out with their masks on.

"1008","People say ""check the settings"" but don't say what settings to check when joining a lobby. Here's my quick list:

0) Check the list of roles - make sure you know what roles are on, so that you don't end up hard accusing someone of being evil since they vented but they turn out to be Engineer, and that you don't end up tunnelling on someone for killing in front of you only to turn out there was a Shapeshifter, etc.

1) ""Visual Tasks"" On/Off: Some tasks can be seen by other players if this setting is on. This means that if someone sees you doing this task, they can hard clear you, or if someone sees you faking it, they can call you out.

In Skeld, visual tasks include: Trash chute (storage room, you pull down a lever, the visual will be below that on the outer wall of the ship), Shields (shields room, you click hexagonal panels, the visual is the lights outside the ship getting brighter), Asteroids/Weapons (weapons room, you shoot some asteroids on a screen, the visual is outside the ship with the guns shooting), and Med Scan (medbay room, you get scanned, the visual is you getting scanned). In Polus, there is also Med Scan and Weapons, they are just in different rooms. These are the two most common maps.

Note: good players will be able to tell if you are faking med scan even with visual tasks off, due to the animation of the player walking on to the scanner. Better players will be able to fake this ""walk"".

2) ""Taskbar Updates"": The taskbar shows in the top left. The setting set to ""Always"" means that the moment a crewmate finishes a task, the taskbar will move. If you fake a task as an impostor, make sure to not get caught by someone seeing you ""finish"" the task without the taskbar moving. (The other possible settings don't require you do this)

3) ""Anonymous Votes"": If you vote someone, does it tell everyone that \*you\* did (Off)? Or just that someone did (On)? Make sure you aren't voting in an obviously evil way if everyone can tell if you were the one voting.

4) ""Crewmate Vision"": 1.0x and lower means that calling lights can actually help you quite a bit as impostor, as crew vision will be pretty small if lights are off. Higher than 1.0x lights are less useful, as crew can still see a lot even when they're ""off"".","among-us","0","","people say check the settings but dont say what settings to check when joining a lobby heres my quick list

"1232","I main a few heroes so here I go:


**Lifeweaver**
------------
**Cleansing Grasp:**

In addition to the cleanse, it also adds a 50 health heal over time if you cleanse something.

*Reasoning:*

This perk is only useful if the enemy team has anti-heal, otherwise it's not really that useful. Adding a conditional buff for it would be nice, because Life Cycle is 100% a better choice that allows you to be more aggressive with your positioning.


**Lifeweaving:**

Your primary heal now also bounces to an ally near your target, healing them for 50% of the heal you hit on the main target.

*Reasoning:*

Original lifeweaving gives Lifeweaver **more** healing which he doesn't need; this perk would alleviate his weakness with healing multiple targets; right now it's competing with a perk that alleviates his lack of damage. Superbloom also synergizes with Life Cycle, which makes it the obvious choice.


**Sombra**
-----------
**~~Viral Efficacy:~~ Worm:**
If an enemy under the effects of a virus dies, they will shoot a virus projectile towards the nearest enemy target.

*Reasoning:*

I personally haven't found much use for this perk other than that it also procs on player owned objects like turrets and such. I feel like a spreading virus is also more aligned with her ability and hero fantasy.


**White hat:**

Heals for 100 + 20% of the allies' max health for 2 seconds. Hacking on an allied target cannot be cancelled by damage.

*Reasoning:*

I find this perk fun just for the hero fantasy alone. I just think that it needs a bit of oomph to be powerful enough to be taken.


**Stack Overflow:**

Virus will apply hack's effect onto the target it hits.

*Reasoning:*

I know this sounds crazy, but hear me out: This will give you the double amount of silence if you hack a target normally, wait for a second and then throw your virus on the target. 

On the flip-side if you hit a target with a virus: You cannot hack them with your normal hack anymore. This forces you to consider your options and play differently which I think is a really good thing about the perks. Also this would alleviate Sombra players not picking either one of their major perks sometimes.


**Symmetra**
----------------
**Advanced Teleportation:**

Teleporter’s range is increased by 50%. Increases the interaction range by 100%.

*Reasoning:*

The perk is already really silly, because the teleporter reaches further than a lot of the sight lines in the game. Being able to interact with the teleporter from further away also encourages you and your teammates to use it more.


**~~Shield Battery:~~ Shield Generator**

Symmetra can now choose between using her teleporter or placing down a shield generator. It gives 50 shield health to allies in a 20 meter radius of the shield generator.

The shield generator lasts forever until it's destroyed by Symmetra pressing her Ability 2 button again or it being destroyed.

*Reasoning:*

Hero fantasy perks are fun and it would also give Symmetra something from her past to play with. Similarly to the White Hat perk, it would be fun to see DPS characters with supportive options in form of perks!","overwatch","0","","i main a few heroes so here i go

"441","Instead of trusting their own ability to build effective moderation tools

Another way to put this is riot has decided it is cost prohibitive to make an effective moderation tool.

I think that is a fine reason. 

What about if someone accidentally tilts teammates from how they talk? I'm not saying that person is being toxic or gets a false positive report from getting reported repeatedly, but that they will come across as negative.  Unintentionally they would tilt the team just from how they speak. That would lower their chance to win if they participate in voice chat or if they choose not to join it ( it would tilt the team from the inherent opt in aspect if they don't join voice chat).

I am monotone. I have had friends think I am mad at them because I am monotone when I focus and I did not realize that for a while and how people would interpret what I said.

God, I kid you not, I just stopped playing and pulled my dick out. “fuck, Fuck!” I was yelling in voice chat. I just wanted to hear her voice again. “Please,” I moaned. But she left the lobby. I was crying and covered in my own cum, but I remembered that I could find recent teammates in the ubiplay friends tab. I frantically closed down siege and opened the tab, to find out she had TTV IN HER NAME!!! She was streaming, and only had 100 viewers!!! The competition was low, so I made the first move and donated my months rent to her. I was already about to pre. She read my donation in the chat. God this is the happiest I’ve been in a long time. I did a little research, and found out where she goes to school, but I am a little nervous to talk to her in person, and need support.

"259","I wish that the LoL competitive system was more like CS2. All teams are in a giant rating list, top X get invited to tier 1 events, those blow can freely go to tier 2 events etc. 

That way if you start terrorizing the tier 2 scene you can surpass the bottom tier 1 teams and get the invites to the tier 1 events.

Also all of the rmr/play in systems are nice chances too. 

Cause the big issue league's pro play is the slots for it cost $$$$$$ meaning that you likely won't see a team form, rise to the top of tier 2 and continue to tier 1. They will probably split once the players get offers.

"56","First off: I am not joking. I wish I was joking.

I've been with my wonderful boyfriend Greg for over 4 years now, and this Christmas was our third spent together. He's so much fun to be around, handsome, charming, and our sex life is great. Except for one small problem.

Every year now starting in December he starts referring to his cum as ""Greggnog."" When I first heard him say this, it was in the context of a joke, so I laughed, and then I forgot about it. A few days after this, we're exchanging some spicy texts before he gets home from work he says to me, in all seriousness, ""I can't wait to pour Greggnog all over your face."" I could not believe he just said that to me, but I didn't know what else to do at the time but go along with it.

Fast forward to this December. This phrase re-enters his vocabulary at the same time every year. It makes me cringe beyond belief, but until this year he used it sparingly enough for me to just be able to laugh and say ""shut the fuck up.""

I'm sure that 2020 has done at least some irreparable psychic damage to all people, but unfortunately, for my boyfriend, this has manifested in the form of him referring to his cum as ""Greggnog"" non-stop. This month he has been using the term almost exclusively, in all contexts, and it is driving me batshit insane. I sat him down to talk last week, and I asked him very clearly and directly to stop. At the time, he said he would, and it did slow down for a few days, but it is now four days after Christmas and he's back at it again with no end in sight.

He absolutely means the world to me, and I saw myself spending the rest of my life with him, but I have serious doubts now whether or not I can if every Christmas is going to be like this. So please, reddit, what do I do to make this stop for good?","classic","1","0.039488320355951","first off i am not joking i wish i was joking

Bonus points for it not wasting your time if the matchmaker is having a brainfart and making a stompy lobby, no other game mode ends as quickly if you're getting rolled as Clash does.

It's probably due to the way achievements are calculated.  The game didn't have them until the first roles update in November of 2021.  Everyone that downloaded and played the game but stopped before that update won't have the achievement.  By late 2021 most of the covid players had quit so I'm honestly surprised the number isn't lower tbh.  I have it on my PC but I won't have it on my phone, for example.

"292","The only argument I can get against fearless is how it will likely decrease the quality of gameplay overall.

Patches come as such a high pace that it is not possible for proplayers to always play the top 10 best picks of their role at maximum potentiality, and this is why most of the time they go for comfort picks: it allows them to spend their training time training macroplay and perfect even more those few picks.

"1203","Honestly, just treat it like quick play. Cause that’s essentially what comp is now, just (potentially) longer quick play games. Flashpoint, push, control, and clash, those are all the same length of games! You can now get banned in leaving quick play, but you’re banned from the Whole game, and there’s already a lot of sweats in there as well, so why not just commit to comp? Also they got rid of the comp point rewards (the now red points, formerly purple points) for being a higher rank, so it’s essentially (and literally) pointless now, besides for a single season bragging rights. 

Mostly it’s just a mindset thing at the end of the day. I’m more likely to do better if I’m just thinking of ‘having fun’ over ‘wanting to win’, but also looking for ways to improve when I don’t, i.e. better positioning, staying in sight of healers, paying attention to the board state, etc.","overwatch","0","","honestly just treat it like quick play cause that’s essentially what comp is now just potentially longer quick play games flashpoint push control and clash those are all the same length of games you can now get banned in leaving quick play but you’re banned from the whole game and there’s already a lot of sweats in there as well so why not just commit to comp also they got rid of the comp point rewards the now red points formerly purple points for being a higher rank so it’s essentially and literally pointless now besides for a single season bragging rights

My guess is they will look at the viewership and see if they will expand it new year.  Remember this is a 1 week event and teams are already complaining about the rushed schedule.  KC just had their LEC finals one week prior and LPL is starting new week.

I think Riot did listen to fans and try to fit in a 3rd international but scheduling was always going to make things pretty tight.  At the end of the day, I think many fans want to see more top teams playing each other (internationals, more Bo3/5, more double Elim) but that has to be balanced with region play and teams that don’t make the playoffs.

"501","The biggest potential problem I can see is the lack of good tempo defensive tools (except flutterwing guardian). Having time to play ensmallen (and then draw enough minions to make up the tempo loss) or play the mage location and not die in aggressive matchups may be tough. So 4 of your 3 drops are dead draws there. Then reforestation is slow to draw 2, at 3 turns in hand, and is a downturn tempo wise too. Ensmallen is what I'm least excited about personally.. Reduces damage of your minions and you don't have many high cost+attack or high impact minions to come down and regain the dead turn 3.

I saw mention of ogre in the comments with him being a placeholder, and, the evergreen stag- A 6/7 for 6 (or 5/7 for 5 with ensmallen) elusive lifesteal taunt may be worth considering. That or sunfury protector from core to taunt up 2 hero powers, or a hero power and another body if you can get it/have it on board. Sing a long buddy>hero power>sunfury is a pretty good turn if you've got your hero power to a decent size and it protects sing a long for next turn potentially too which could snowball the game turn 6 and 7. Mark of the wild is also worth considering as a nature spell and taunt activator but I feel is weaker than the other 2 options on the whole, especially with a lack of 1 drops to target on turn 2. Sunfury feels like the winner for me here as it's low cost and can give 2 taunts for 1 card.

There's Shaladrassil too. Whether it's good or not I'm not sure, as 7 mana seems really high in a deck that wants to hero power practically every turn.. But shaladrassil is 3 nature spells, a good amount of tempo/value late game, and potentially one of the only board clears available to nature shaman.

Just my thoughts anyway, and last of all- have fun!","hearthstone","0","","the biggest potential problem i can see is the lack of good tempo defensive tools except flutterwing guardian having time to play ensmallen and then draw enough minions to make up the tempo loss or play the mage location and not die in aggressive matchups may be tough so  of your  drops are dead draws there then reforestation is slow to draw  at  turns in hand and is a downturn tempo wise too ensmallen is what im least excited about personally reduces damage of your minions and you dont have many high costattack or high impact minions to come down and regain the dead turn

"1294","This is so much fun.   

Without map/mode context, it's impossible.  A truly horrible composition needs a map/objective context to express its uselessness.

Let's take the rather extreme case of defense on Kings Row: A very tight choke with LOS to the attacker spawn with little open space, on a classic map. 

I'd take Ball, Sombra, Genji, Lucio, Ana  

The team isn't able to exploit the map advantages at all. Nobody can pressure a static position/corner. The tight choke is essentially useless. 

The flankers have no valuable space behind/beside the enemy to operate.  The high and low spawn doors turn everything in front of the choke into a kill zone to poke  heroes without recourse. Sombra has no space to set up attacks. Genji can't engage in front of the choke without being exposed in similar fashion. 

Ball can't swing well off the bus... He'd have to either bait people through the choke into the circus around the statue, which would be a death sentence to Ana, or swing into the space around the bus/enemy spawn off the buildings, accomplishing nothing in relation to the objective, and exposing himself to fire from both spawn doors. He's in an impossible dilemma: wait for an attack on his backline (which is essentially only Ana) or push forward into a hopeless and pointless fight in front of open spawn doors. 

Lucio's choices would be even worse. He has to decide whether or not to support the lonely besieged Ana at the backline, or dive with the flankers into a snake pit of certain death, in front of the spawn doors on the front side of the gate. 

Given how stupid all of that would be, the whole team could then choose to play defensive tactics at the gate choke, but that turns off every advantage the composition holds. They're now playing brawl tactics with heroes that have no abilities or passives that serve that strategy. Hopeless. 

Basically, this is a pure dive comp, in a map situation where dive tactics accomplish nothing but a quick suicide.","overwatch","0","","this is so much fun

ball cant swing well off the bus hed have to either bait people through the choke into the circus around the statue which would be a death sentence to ana or swing into the space around the busenemy spawn off the buildings accomplishing nothing in relation to the objective and exposing himself to fire from both spawn doors hes in an impossible dilemma wait for an attack on his backline which is essentially only ana or push forward into a hopeless and pointless fight in front of open spawn doors 

lucios choices would be even worse he has to decide whether or not to support the lonely besieged ana at the backline or dive with the flankers into a snake pit of certain death in front of the spawn doors on the front side of the gate 

given how stupid all of that would be the whole team could then choose to play defensive tactics at the gate choke but that turns off every advantage the composition holds theyre now playing brawl tactics with heroes that have no abilities or passives that serve that strategy hopeless 

basically this is a pure dive comp in a map situation where dive tactics accomplish nothing but a quick suicide"

"580","You'll always find people who say never do this, or always do that, but it really depends on circumstances.

The game's supposed to be fun. The absolute minimum you need is One Good Deck that you enjoy. If you don't have that, do whatever it takes to get it.

On all of the other decisions, play the odds. What are the odds you might like Class X, which you hate now, in a year's time? If you're totally new, you may have no idea, so play for a while and get a better feel for Class X before you make a drastic decision. If you have your One Good Deck you can afford to do that. And if you still hate Class X by the time you're totally bored with your Good Deck (or it's stopped being a Good Deck) then go ahead and dust Class X. The more you enjoy the game, the more likely you are to have the dust you need if you ever do change your mind.

The same applies to rules like ""Only dust when something is nerfed"". It's good advice, but if you don't have an interesting Good Deck right now, it's probably not the best advice, because the best way of getting more decks is by playing more, and that won't happen if you're not enjoying the game. (At least it shouldn't happen, the game's supposed to be fun).

Oh, and while you have a small collection, the gold you have should probably be spent on maximising the number of cards you have, not the amount of dust you have. So although, again, the ""Buy the Miniset for dust"" is good advice, it's probably not the best advice for you personally right now.

On which class to dust if you ever do, what playstyles do you prefer? How do you feel about RNG (like it or hate it?)","hearthstone","0","","youll always find people who say never do this or always do that but it really depends on circumstances

"1210","I think a good balance would be your have to have +1 more person on your team on the point to capture it.

So red has 1, blue must have 2. But the balance part would be it would only count as 1 person towards speed for blue. So if you wanted full speed of capture, you would need to have 4 people more than the enemy team. 

And the way to make it more competitive, the final capture point is immune to this rule. So anyone can stop it, which would make clutch comebacks still viable.

That is for ranked rebalancing. 

I am sure they would have to change a few tbongs, but still would work as a more balanced method to keep gameplay moving along and game time down.","overwatch","0","","i think a good balance would be your have to have  more person on your team on the point to capture it

"592","Old player opinion here. Backstory: started grinding standard ranked since Rastakhan Rumble untill Ashes of Outland when I took a break, returned to the game in The Great Dark Beyond where I grind only wild ranked. 
That said I don’t have a complete picture of meta’s during the last 2-3 years. 
I enjoyed the SC miniset. Of course I played Zerg DK, who hasn’t. 
The deck is not busted because of infestor, it’s busted because you’re able to trigger it’s deathrattle too many times or reborn it too many times. It’s busted because you summon cheap shit that has too many stats like 0-1 mana summon 2x 8/8 zerglings or larger, or a huge baneling + reborn, or a huge lurker. The fact that you can reborn an entire 8/8+ board with viper. Or the fact that after you reborn your minions they have more than 1 hp. 

In standard the deck will loose the yodeler. I think it’s fine. 
The zergling nerf is fine. It alleviates some of the problems in standard + wild. Also solves some bullshit from the hunter deck. 
8 mana Kerrigan is fine. 

However removing the health buff from infestor is too much. Maybe they should have “reworked” the reborn effect so that it would work as intended, i.e. resummon the zergs with just 1 hp and no health aura. Only with attack aura. 

I mean I get it, the plan for zergs is too swarm the board. You will swarm it for sure, but the minions will be removed too easy.

As for wild sure, the deck was strong. Maybe a bit too strong but after the nerfs it will just be unplayable.","hearthstone","0","","old player opinion here backstory started grinding standard ranked since rastakhan rumble untill ashes of outland when i took a break returned to the game in the great dark beyond where i grind only wild ranked

"814","I feel like there would be a lot less trash settings if Innersloth had thought about how the settings work more.

I think it should be done a connected scaling basis, instead of completely customisable.

So for example; if the host increases the imps kill cd, then the amount of tasks should increase accordingly - then you'd never have 3 tasks with 45 seconds kill cool down sort of games.

Imp vision should always be at least 0.25x better than crew, so the more crew vision gets increased then Imp vision will always increase along with it (but always only at least 0.25 - so if crew vision is 1.0 and Imp vision is 2.5, the Imp vision wouldn't start scaling until crew vision was increased to 2.25 if that makes sense)

If player speed is reduced, then the kill distance should go to short, and then increase the speed it should go to long

You get the idea, connect some of these settings instead of having them all be independent of eachother and fully customisable


Also have you guys ever seen how trash the ""recommended settings"" (called ""core settings"" now since the menu updates) are?

45 seconds kill cd, 4 tasks, player speed x1.0, kill distance medium, 15 seconds discuss with 120 seconds voting?

"1007","Visuals are tasks that other people can watch you do and you can be cleared by them. Trash, asteroids, med scan, and shields are all visuals on Skeld, and Skeld is the most commonly played map. Visuals can be turned off by the host, however it’s not very common, and you can also check the settings of the lobby you join before the game starts, it will tell you if visuals are on or off.

Engineer wasn’t always a role on the game, so a lot of people think that venting is automatically sus - it’s not. Hosts can choose to make everyone an engineer if they wanted to (obv besides imp), so that’s just something to keep in mind. I like to check the settings before the game starts to make note of how many engineers there are, if any. As an imp, I suggest not killing near vents if there’s engineers. If you do choose to kill near vents, sabotage comms first. Sabotaging comms prevents people from being able to enter the vents, imposter is excluded from that prevention. 
Sabotaging comms also temporarily disables cameras until the sabotage is fixed. 

If you’re an engineer and you’re hiding in the vents, people can clean you out of the vent if they have the ‘clean vent’ task, this clears them. 
If you have the vent cleaning task but you have no visuals and there are engineers in your game, you can ask an engineer to vent in the room that you have the task in, and you can clean them out of the vent to prove that you’re clear by tasking. 

There are cameras around the map in the security hallway, medbay to upper engine hallway, o2 to navigation hallway, and the admin to storage hallway. There are little lights on the cameras that blink red when somebody is actively in security on cams. If nobody is on cams, there is no blinking light on the cameras. 

Hosts CAN be kicked from their own lobbies, just a forewarning in case this ever happens to you lmfao.

"829","Multi-faceted issue.

At it's base is the fact that this game is very slow to introduce new elements (maps, roles, cosmetics, etc), so naturally, people are going to get bored and want to modify the way it's played. It's been so for years, from the first (IMHO, better) unofficial hide-and-seek lobbies to actual modded lobbies (TOH, Deathrun, Speedrun, etc). So that's one cause for people making rules.

The ""no voting til 6"" rule isn't one I've heard. Sort of seems like the host wants longer games, where crew don't get voted out for stupid reasons (venting when there are engies, ""X is following me"", etc). But if the host has full lobbies and players who stay, SOMEONE must like it. I don't think I would be one of those people, so you know what I would do?

I'd just find another lobby. If there is a lobby with rules you don't like, don't be a petulant child (""Become ungovernable"", as one responder said) and break the rules because you don't like them, or whine about the rules. Just fucking leave. If you REALLY think you voice is SO important that the host needs to know why you are leaving, do so politely (""Oh, those rules don't look like they're for me, but have fun!"", then out). You aren't going to change anyone's mind by acting like a twat and breaking the rules, or just calling them stupid.

Apart from all that, AFK players, and the rules made to protect them, frustrate me as well. If the game were so important that they HAD to stay in the lobby, regardless of whether they are doing anything, copy the lobby code before you go AFK, or as soon as you ENTER a lobby, and LEAVE if you know you are going to be AFK. I don't host, but if I didn't, AFK players would not be protected and would be booted after two or three consecutive rounds of being AFK. They are a drag on the game regardless of whether they are imp or crew, and whether they have been killed to not (dead AFK crew STILL don't do tasks)","among-us","0","","multifaceted issue

at its base is the fact that this game is very slow to introduce new elements maps roles cosmetics etc so naturally people are going to get bored and want to modify the way its played its been so for years from the first imho better unofficial hideandseek lobbies to actual modded lobbies toh deathrun speedrun etc so thats one cause for people making rules

the no voting til  rule isnt one ive heard sort of seems like the host wants longer games where crew dont get voted out for stupid reasons venting when there are engies x is following me etc but if the host has full lobbies and players who stay someone must like it i dont think i would be one of those people so you know what i would do

id just find another lobby if there is a lobby with rules you dont like dont be a petulant child become ungovernable as one responder said and break the rules because you dont like them or whine about the rules just fucking leave if you really think you voice is so important that the host needs to know why you are leaving do so politely oh those rules dont look like theyre for me but have fun then out you arent going to change anyones mind by acting like a twat and breaking the rules or just calling them stupid

apart from all that afk players and the rules made to protect them frustrate me as well if the game were so important that they had to stay in the lobby regardless of whether they are doing anything copy the lobby code before you go afk or as soon as you enter a lobby and leave if you know you are going to be afk i dont host but if i didnt afk players would not be protected and would be booted after two or three consecutive rounds of being afk they are a drag on the game regardless of whether they are imp or crew and whether they have been killed to not dead afk crew still dont do tasks"

Rexxar & Misha are two characters controlled by one player. Misha is a bear pet that some of rexxars abilities controls. I'm not all that good with my hands and even I didn't mind playing it, it also helped that they were very tanky and Rexxar was technically a medium range character.

The Lost Vikings are 3 characters in one, each capable of soaking experience and moderate fighting but it's like trying to play StarCraft on steroids if you are jumped in there different places at the same time.

"174","plants decide fights unless you are one shotting the opponent or they are one shotting you. Hexgates can also be quite impactful for the team that wants to run away/avoid getting engaged on.

 Think about when you can save rerolls and when you need to use them (is there something you could get that is much better than your current options?).

Think about when to buy anvils or full items, you can also buy stat anvils, you can sell starter item or even boots to buy a full item one round earlier, all these things make a difference.

Also before every round look at the enemy team, their augments, items and what map you are playing on and try to find what is your win condition(s). For example if you're playing zyra lux or something like that, against mundo tahm, your goal should be to run, avoid being in the same screen as the enemy and only contest plants if anything.","league-of-legends","0","","plants decide fights unless you are one shotting the opponent or they are one shotting you hexgates can also be quite impactful for the team that wants to run awayavoid getting engaged on

And weirdly I wouldn't mind a really British male character so you can have a Kingsman/Bond vibe. But that region is already pretty well represented.

More European flavour would also be great - some Slavic or more around the Mediterranean.","overwatch","0","","would like some mongolian character in the vein of the hu

When I am playing in iron/bronze/silver the issue I have is the utter lack of respect for my effort on behalf of my team mates. I am trying my best each and every game. Almost every game I have 0 deaths for around 10-15 minutes. Meanwhile my entire team accumulated 25 deaths. Why should I respect your time if you don't respect mine? You're clearly not even trying if you die 5 times in 8 minutes. I refuse to believe you can be that dumb. So who is really trolling?

1. Team 5 would have to essentially create multiple versions of each card.


2. Balance every neutral, DK, and possible DK discovery around every variation of these variant cards.

"381","Runes: Definetely need to be reassessed. Theres too many that are simply unclickable when compared to other runes in their slot. Summoner Spellbook is a good example of Keystones that almost nobody ever uses. Which is a shame because its a super cool rune, but that doesnt make it good. I legit cant remember the last time I saw spellbook in a match.

Items and champions feel alright to me. New champs have always been a little op and I think its good they update older champs to be more relevant. Items feel the best they have in awhile imo. ADC itemization could be a bit better, but its not bad either.

There's some matches that the enemy team's only mission is to make your life miserable, so don't sweat it too much. For those times, you should learn on the side a tank with little to no hard counters: Ram, Zarya, maybe Hazard or JQ.

You'll eventually get to a point you can comfortably deal with 2 or 3 counters. 5 counters I'd recommend to swap unless you're rolling them. Otherwise, just swap to one of those tanks and cash in your free win.

Machista: Women hater. Dunno why this would be bad, in LAN eGirl flaming is a reaaal issue. Maybe has to do with that. If you play enchanter you are assumed 1. Bad 2.Female. 3. Carried or duo boosted.

"1245","Aim does come with practice but quality of practice is where you can go wrong. I wish I could credit the guy I picked up this aim warm up routine from but I just don't remember. I just know it instantly clicked for me.

The gist of it is to enter an aiming custom game mode (I think the popular one is VAXTA) and follow 4 steps. Set up a timer maybe, 3-5 minutes per step or whatever works for you and get rolling.

Step 1: Hands off the keyboard just track the bots moving around with your eyes only. One a time.

Step 2: Use only the keyboard to mirror the movement of one bot of your choice. Try to follow them with your crosshair without using the mouse at all.

Step 3: Stand still and just track a bot with your mouse only. You can alternate between just tracking and tracking + shooting if you like.

Step 4: Combine all the steps together.

This basically deconstructs the elements that make up great aim and makes sure you put time into your weak spots individually so you don't end up winging your aim forever.","overwatch","0","","aim does come with practice but quality of practice is where you can go wrong i wish i could credit the guy i picked up this aim warm up routine from but i just dont remember i just know it instantly clicked for me

the gist of it is to enter an aiming custom game mode i think the popular one is vaxta and follow  steps set up a timer maybe  minutes per step or whatever works for you and get rolling

step  hands off the keyboard just track the bots moving around with your eyes only one a time

step  use only the keyboard to mirror the movement of one bot of your choice try to follow them with your crosshair without using the mouse at all

step  stand still and just track a bot with your mouse only you can alternate between just tracking and tracking  shooting if you like

step  combine all the steps together

this basically deconstructs the elements that make up great aim and makes sure you put time into your weak spots individually so you dont end up winging your aim forever"

"57","NA aka Near Airport are the first region to complete the airport speedrun any%. After dominating the airport speedrun scene for several years, competition proved to be stifling despite tough competition coming through from the LEC team Mad Lions. This last year, NA announced a new approach that would bring fresh life and competition back into the scene.

&nbsp;

LTA aka Los Terminal Americano is the new airport hub designed to host not just the usual NA markets, but also expand into Latin American markets. The hub contains North and South terminals that also act as conference halls, to not only host the regional speedrun competitions but also act as the international hub for overseas tournaments, ensuring that the LTA teams have the best possible routes in both departing from and arriving back at the airport to maximise speedrun efficiency.

&nbsp;

In the inaugural LTA competition, Team Liquid smashed their way to the regional title, although Brazilian competition was fierce. Subsequently TL have once again dominated the First Stand tournament with a 3-7 individual game score. TL took inspiration from their coach who left for the airport ahead of the team to scout out the best routes, and this combined with their game score have ensured they are the first team to arrive back at the airport.

&nbsp;

LTA commissioner Mark Zimmerman was interviewed, ""We are extremely happy with how LTA has set us up well for future expansion and that we've seen such prominent results already. The new LTA hub hosts a suite of modern airport features including Korean (and other regions) immigration fasttrack, a wide security hall to maximise throughput, and of course Tesla-powered elevators and walkways to get people through the airport as fast as possible."" He continued, ""This investment will surely inject more passion and entertainment into our region and ensures that we are in good steading to continue to dominate the airport speedrun any% for the next few decades.""","league-of-legends","0","","na aka near airport are the first region to complete the airport speedrun any after dominating the airport speedrun scene for several years competition proved to be stifling despite tough competition coming through from the lec team mad lions this last year na announced a new approach that would bring fresh life and competition back into the scene

"384","""Every other team is fighting for a spot in the next stage"" is a hilarious argument when it's 5 teams and 4 go through

The problem is the amount of teams. 5 teams from 5 regions will never feel like a tournament, and with the level gaps between regions the level of play / excitement is just missing

Double the teams and the entire feel of the tournament changes. It did wonders for the quality of MSI and I just can't comprehend why we are trying to run it back with First Stand

"1340","The thing about me is that the *entire reason* I began even playing hero shooters is because I'm team-oriented. Idk what it is, but I always watch my team and our surroundings. 

I love being the big ""slow"" (ofc not always the case in this game) character with a good high level of health, and sometimes a huge shield to protect teammates. It feels nice. I'm not the most aggressive player in role based games. I don't care about domination or numbers. I just like supporting others, be it healing, augments, debuffing enemies, meat shielding, you name it. Synergy's my business, and cuz, my business is a-boomin. 

I play Zar and Queen specifically because they're 2 Tanks that *directly* support the team with their abilities. Sigma ult got you? So does my Battle Shout. You little Supports getting bullied by a Genji? Not if my bubbles got you. 

If I hear a ping that isn't in front of me when I'm playing a Dive Tank, I immediately check my backline. If I see my habibis getting bullied, I'll crumple your ass and toss you back in your spawn.

"1157","I had this conversation with a friend who plays league, and tried OW. 

It doesn't have strategy like Seige. The strategies are completely different considering one is a tactical first person shooter and the other is a competitive team-based shooter with wildly different abilities and pacings. In Seige you don't have to worry about a Junkrat taking you out from the top ropes with an explosive. You just need to point and shoot, be the last person standing/secure your objectives. And the person with the more skill generally wins. 

Overwatch requires knowledge on every character and their ability. It requires being able to scan high and low ground, make sense of audio cues, hit shots, out play your enemy, utilizing the utility in kits, etc. The game is nothing but strategy unless you are quite literally running it down mid dying over and over again. And I think OW offers an amazing skill ceiling for all types of players, which you can't really find in games nowadays. Normally it's simply who has the best aim/reflexes. Not with OW.","overwatch","0","","i had this conversation with a friend who plays league and tried ow

"452","Dang. Wow. Holy macaroni. 60 packs? That’s a lot of packs. 60 packs contain 300 cards. That’s a lot of cards. Your typical Hearthstone™ deck features only 30 cards, the main exception being decks which include the legendary minion Prince Renethal from hit expansion Murder at Castle Nathria, which contain 40 cards. However this expansion has now rotated to the wild format, so as a standard player I will mostly be using 30 cards per deck. No more, and no less. 30 shall be the number of cards in a deck. This means that if I win these precious 300 cards, I can make 10 decks! Now you might think “who could possibly keep track of that many decks!”, but, and it might be wise to sit down for this one, blizzard has actually, in their eternal generosity, given us access to 18 whole deck slots. Nobody knows if it is actually possible to have this many decks at the same time without your mind exploding out of confusion. Now, as a seasoned Hearthstone™ player, I have already managed to gather a sizeable collection of 240 cards (pretty impressive I know), enough for exactly 8 decks.

You also gain 6 skins for free that you get to keep - Cardboard Reinhardt, Turtle Ship D.Va, Street Runner Genji, Cyberdragon Hanzo, Honey Bee Mercy and Cleric Lifeweaver :)

Hope this makes sense, it’s another solution but you don’t have to keep the skin - plus you’ll get to try out various other skins :)

"216","Depends on what ur goals are for the game. Are u just playing for fun? If so, it doesn't matter and u should just play what u enjoy. If role swapping is gonna acheive that, then go for it

If however, ur playing to climb and improve srsly, then it's often recommended to stick to one role and 1-3 champs. This is bc constantly switching roles and champs just means that u aren't learning the full dynamic of ur champion and the lane. Not only that, but u'll have scattered knowledge from all the different roles and champs being played, which can easily lead to information overload, resulting in little to nothing being learnt overall. To give an example, everytime u pick up a new role or add a new champion to ur pool, u have to divert a large portion of ur focus into figuring out how to pilot ur champion and role dynamics. This takes away from ur mental capacity to focus on laning essentials such as last hitting, trading, cd tracking, jg tracking, map awareness etc. Compare this to if u are already familiar on a champion. Piloting the champ becomes second nature to u, and u don't need to divert as much attention into thinking about how to play ur champion (eg. getting comfortable with their ranges, mana management, cds etc), and can instead focus more on ur in-game decision-making skills

That being said, if ur able to get the best of both worlds (find a role/champ u enjoy and spam it), it would be most ideal. After all, playing what u enjoy will make the learning experience more fun and rewarding than if u were to play smth that u don't enjoy. Forcing urself to play smth u don't enjoy will feel like a chore, resulting in burnout and/or make u lose motivation to play. Compare this to playing a champ that u enjoy: even if u lose at least u will still feel motivated to keep learning and improving due to champ enjoyment

I recommend taking all these factors into consideration when deciding. Hope that helps!","league-of-legends","0","","depends on what ur goals are for the game are u just playing for fun if so it doesnt matter and u should just play what u enjoy if role swapping is gonna acheive that then go for it

"906","As others are saying, this isn't a subreddit rule. It's a rule on the platform itself regarding witch-hunting. 

Especially if it has the potential of getting to the point where people take being a vigilante too far and try to do things like find who is trolling in a lobby and doxx them publicly, well meaning or not. 

Also especially with people potentially trying to track down others to harass them actively on purpose. Like if I said ""I found a troll with the name xima†r0llx, go harass them"", that would be against terms of service on the platform as a whole and could get the subreddit banned. Similar to the now long defunct r/FindBostonBombers, wrongly identifying people as suspects. 

The people who do post names in good faith, I get it. You mean well and have good intentions (presumably). However, some things, I cannot allow if it has the potential for people to interpret it as something to take serious action on, including harming or harassing someone.

Edit: Also posts that are literally just about someone saying stuff in the chat are considered low effort. Playing Among Us (or really almost any game) and seeing someone be inappropriate or doing something wrong is like going in a forest and seeing trees, both are things that will easily happen, given enough time. Trolls do what they do because it gets them attention. By posting it here, you give them exactly what they want, providing motivation to continue trolling.

"406","~~Unlikely to ever happen since they'd need new VAs. Off the top of my head I can't remember them ever bringing in a new VA just for a single skin.~~ 

edit: They *have* brought in VAs for single skins in the past, so that might not be as hard of a sell after all. Still, though, it would be a lot of work - they'd need new VAs and, while all legendaries have different models, a genderswap model would potentially be drastically different, which would be more work. 

There's also the question of, like, do you just make a genderswap of the base skin? Do you make an entire new skin line with it's own theme? There's no way they're getting 170+ new voice actors so they'd have to pick who's getting these, how do they pick and what kind of expectations would that set? There's a lot to consider, and when Riot can just slap a 250$ price tag on a chroma and make gangbusters, they're not exactly itching for innovation.

"1305","Honestly, with the Repair, Basiton is just a better designed Roadhog; He's a big DPS wannabe with a self heal and an ability dedicated to deleting stuff at range, biggest differences are that Bastion is more vulnerable up close and has an even worse ult in exchange for better mid-range damage and even some mobility. 

Hell, I'd argue Bastion does the ""Use the threat of big damage to make space"" motif better since his ability being a delayed transformation followed by a stream of damage makes it more telegraphed and, well, *tank* like compared to Hog's hook being an instant-death button if you can aim.   
  
So, yeah, give Bastion more health and make the repair a base part of his kit and he'd fit right at home in the tank role.","overwatch","0","","honestly with the repair basiton is just a better designed roadhog hes a big dps wannabe with a self heal and an ability dedicated to deleting stuff at range biggest differences are that bastion is more vulnerable up close and has an even worse ult in exchange for better midrange damage and even some mobility

"2","How do I get my husband to stop going ‘Goblin Mode’ during sex?

TLDR; My husband says ‘Goblin Mode activated’ when we start to have sex, growls and acts like a caveman, and then says ‘Goblin Mode off’ when we stop, and then pretends not to remember afterward.

I really love my husband and he’s always been great in bed. But recently he’s been acting really weird. So, a couple of days ago, my son went on a rampage through our house and said he was in ‘Goblin Mode’. We didn’t really know what to do with him, so we sent him to live with my parents so he can go to a special needs school. My husband a really great relationship with our son and loved him more than anything. Naturally, he was upset when he had to leave. He’s an incredibly tough man, but this was the first time I’ve ever seen him cry. I think since then, he’s been a little emotionally unwell. I’ve heard him muttering, ‘Goblin’ repeatedly when he didn’t notice me, staring blankly into his food, and just going alone by himself to do who knows what. I feel awful for him, but we both agreed that this was for the best. Last night, the day after our son went away, we decided to have sex to relieve our stress. However, my husband said ‘Goblin Mode activated’, starting growling, and went wild having sex with me. Admittedly, it was some of the best and most experimental sex I’ve ever had, but I’m worried that something might be going on with my husband. Any advice?

"851","There are hosts who cheat.  They download modded or hacks, there are even hacks for Android now.

I've been watching a group I play with.  There are 3 who downloaded mods.  We just kicked out a long time regular for proven hacking, and have a list of hackers.  We're not allowing another player into our lobbies who knowingly associates with other highly damaging or cheat hackers.

Those who host, can either have mods or hacks engaged even in a lobby that doesn't load them.  They (depending) can see the roles of all players, maybe see the entire map at once.

Many will act like victims of being killed first, complaining.  This for me is a red flag of a cheater.  The reason is, they follow the imps so they can witness the kill, mistime moving away when cool down runs out.

To follow the rule don't kill host round 1 is either going to drag out the game, or the imp has to kill with host magically right there to witness.  Or, knowledge impossible for them to have regarding the imp and kill.

So, in my group, our current modded host is obviously cheating in this method, by following the imp r1, with the rule don't kill host r1.  I just kill them. I lack any patience for cheaters like this.  It ruins the game. They aren't brave enough to ban me, because I can fill their lobbies.  Since I ignore the rule, so do others.

The host has already been called out by me over instantly knowing who the imps are r1/r2.  They've adjusted their tactics.

I've begun inviting modded hosts with different mods.  It's how I caught the last cheater.  I avoid directly accusing without proof from modded screenshots.

So, why would someone ban you? Many reasons.  None likely legitimate. Political, the color you have, being a better player, looking like someone else's character, and variations of cheating, being wrongfully blamed or accused.

Emotionally immature hosts, bullies, cheaters.  Those are the ones who do it.

I have a good reputation.  I can see when hackers drop code because I use developer's tools that allow me to look at the code at certain points.  I don't play with hacks or mods myself, but have tested mods.  I have zero desire to play a game cheating or with hard to resist exposure to information that gives me an unfair advantage.

It's like sitting down to a game of Scrabble.  All the other players only see their letters.  But this one player can see everyone's letters, and unscramble options for every combination each turn, but thinks they're not cheating somehow.","among-us","0","","there are hosts who cheat  they download modded or hacks there are even hacks for android now

"1297","as for recent comps, supports are the corner stone, so lets start from there.  
zen/mercy/brig/lucio are notorious for low sustain and that can be easily exploited.  
weaver/mercy are known for the lack of the offensive options  
i personally say running  
zen mercy should be a really good start.  
now we need a tank that requires high support sustain and very limited mobility, like mauga, orisa, ramatra, roadhog, reinhardt.  
  
 last piece of the puzzle you want a dps that is not good with mercy (not good with pocket, and doesn't synergize with brawl).  
widowmaker/hanzo already have one shots and don't benefit much of the comp, but they are too strong if in high elo hands.  
Symmetra and junkrat seem the least reliable and (inconsistent/requiring set ups).  


so having a ramatra/ junkrat symmetra, mercy, zen comp would be easily countered.

"221","Why not just change the bounty system from a team-wide system to an individual system?  
If you are way behind in exp and gold (got stomped in lane) you would get a small amount of extra gold (and maybe exp) if you get a kill or a tower. Just you, regardless of who you kill.  
Doesn't matter which team is winning or losing. Just make it based on an individual basis to help players who are really far behind catch back up even just a bit and it basically takes care of itself.  
The entire reason the bounty system is so hard to fix is because there are so many opportunities for the bounty to go to the wrong place or show up on the wrong specific person who doesn't deserve to have a bounty on their head.  
If you make it more like objective bounties; except for individuals instead of teams, then this issue cannot happen.

It doesn't need to be such a strong bounty system that that the losing player can just instantly swing back into the game after 1 or 2 kills. But at least enough to give them a chance to become useful again if they play smart.

It's never made sense to me the way the current bounty system works. Because you can get a bounty on your head for just CSing well, which is absolutely ridiculous.  
The reason the bounty system exists is to help an enemy who you put behind have a chance to catch up.  
When you kill someone, you don't just gain 300g. You also put that enemy like 150-200g behind as well as half a level. The bounty is there to help close this gap when it starts to get too big.  
If you just sit in lane and CS well, you are not putting ANY enemy behind, and therefore, getting a bounty on your head just because you played Kayle or something the way she is meant to be played is literally insane.

The fact that a fed enemy ADC can come kill me midgame when i am playing Kayle or Teemo and collect a bounty even though i am not really fed and they definitely are ahead is mind boggling.

If you set the bounty system up to be individual based instead of team-gold based, you get rid of the chance of a fed person collecting a bounty when they don't need it, which is the opposite of what the bounty system was designed to do.

  
Alternatively: If you have a bounty on your head, you should not be able to collect bounties on other players, unless theirs is higher than yours. And you would get the difference in gold between the two bounties, instead of the full bounty.  
This way fed players cannot just go around collecting more bounties when they definitely are not the person the system was supposed to be helping.","league-of-legends","0","","why not just change the bounty system from a teamwide system to an individual system

"589","The card that makes this really toxic is Horn of Winter.   I swear, I just played a game against a Death Knight had no board except a spawning pool on turn 4 while I had 2 4/5 taunt minions.  He had two horns of winter in his hand, a zerg infestor, Death Growl, and a Brittlebone Buccaneer.  By the end of the turn, he'd cleared my board and had a 4/4 Zergling and his Brittlebone Buccaneer still with the Infestor's death rattle on him, and all his zerg were buffed by 3/3.   Literally zero counterplay-I was holding Hex in my hand but he just completes this entire combo on turn 4 without giving me an opportunity to play a single card.","hearthstone","0","","the card that makes this really toxic is horn of winter   i swear i just played a game against a death knight had no board except a spawning pool on turn  while i had   taunt minions  he had two horns of winter in his hand a zerg infestor death growl and a brittlebone buccaneer  by the end of the turn hed cleared my board and had a  zergling and his brittlebone buccaneer still with the infestors death rattle on him and all his zerg were buffed by    literally zero counterplayi was holding hex in my hand but he just completes this entire combo on turn  without giving me an opportunity to play a single card"

"916","The Boomerang Nebula, located roughly 5,000 light-years away from our solar system, has a temperature of 1 Kelvin (-272 °C or -460 °F) making it the coldest natural place in the universe humanity has discovered. First found in 1995 by astronomers in Chile, we have since learned quite a bit about it. The Boomerang Nebula is a young planetary nebula which has reached such cold temperatures due to its unusually rapid expansion. However, recently, modern online enthusiasts have raised one question science has yet been unable to answer: is it sus?

The profound similarities between the Boomerang Nebula and the characters from the hit game Among Us have led many to believe that the Boomerang Nebula is, in fact, awfully sus, but science has yet to confirm, deny, or even respond to these questions.

"954","The other day, it was “take your kid to work day” at my dad’s job. It was really epic and poggers because I got to skip school for it. As we were walking in, I couldn’t help but notice that the company logo roughly resembled a crewmate from the popular game, Among Us. I asked my father, “Is this the Among Us but real??” My dad replied “No, son, this is the Pepsico corporate office.”

As we entered the building, my dad said “Son, I have a lot of work to do today. You can hang out with the other kids or play on your phone, just please stay on this floor.” He then entered the elevator and left. I turned to the other kids (who were all playing on their phones) and said “Does anyone wanna play some Among Us?” However, no one else wanted to play. I was getting bored, so I decided to explore around a little bit. I walked into the elevator and pressed the button for the top floor.As the elevator door opened, I saw what appeared to be a long hallway. As I was walking down it, I found a door that was labeled “Executive Meeting Room”. The door was unlocked, so I walked in and there were about 15 people in suits and ties around a table. They all looked up at me in confusion. One of them asked me “Hey buddy, are you lost?” I noticed that his nametag read “Hugh Johnson, CFO”. “Does CFO stand for Chungus Fortnite Officer?”, I asked. “No, it does not. And where is your parent? Go back to the bottom floor young man!” He was yelling at me. So I said “You’re sus. I should eject you, Hugh Johnson. Do you have a… HUGE JOHNSON?! That’s funny like Big Chungus, which is the Bugs Bunny from Looney Tunes but a big rabbit!” I laughed. Everyone was looking up at me in shock when I said “Wanna play some Among Us guys?”

The CEO, a very sexy woman, ooga booga awooga, said “Young man, go back to the first floor now!” But the sexy woman I just couldn’t listen to as I admired her. “No, because you have big tits.” Her jaw dropped, and she said, “Young man, this is an important meeting. Get the fuck out!” She then used the intercom to call security. Coming to the realization that I was running out of time, I pulled down my pants to show everyone my Among Us underwear. I jumped up onto the meeting table and started twerking (to make sure everyone saw my among us underwear I got for Christmas) and said “Do you like what you see?” Everyone was yelling at me to get out as I was twerking. “I’m so hot~~~~” I said. The yelling got louder. I ran out of the door and closed it, hoping that security wouldn’t find me. I quickly ran into the elevator and went down.","among-us","1","0.0503316426063207","the other day it was “take your kid to work day” at my dad’s job it was really epic and poggers because i got to skip school for it as we were walking in i couldn’t help but notice that the company logo roughly resembled a crewmate from the popular game among us i asked my father “is this the among us but real” my dad replied “no son this is the pepsico corporate office”

"939","You said settings snobs welcome - here I am! 

Things I like: 

\- Task Bar Updates: Meetings - Thank god.

\- Kill Cooldown: 17.5s - With 2 imps and 15 players, this is decent.

\- Player Speed: 1.5 - Perfect.

\- Emergency Cooldown: 30s - For a lobby with randoms, it's nice that this is very high above the kill cooldown.

\- Tasks: Task settings seem chill.

\_\_\_\_

Things that I don't like and would cause me to leave instantly:

\- Guardian Angel: 8 - Any more than 1 is just an awful time for everyone. Why? It makes games drag on sooo long and robs good impostor players (not me lol, I suck at imp) of deserved wins. Honestly even 1 is pushing it.

\- Noisemaker: 6 - Any more than 1 is just an awful time for everyone. Why? People get cleared for free without even doing anything clever or needing vitals - makes scientist entirely irrelevant, punishes imps for what would otherwise have been clean kills, and makes hiding bodies impossible. Honestly even 1 is pushing it. 

\_\_\_\_

Things I don't like but am willing to live with:

\- Emergency Meetings: 3 - I prefer this at 1, since then people can't spam buttons, and impostors can be clever about who they kill to prevent buttons from being called.

\- Crewmate Vision: 1.25x - I prefer \*max\* 1.0x, as 1.25 you can still see wayyyy too much even when lights are off.

\- Discussion/Voting time: 30s - I prefer longer discussions/voting, so that there's actually time to debate and share information past ""I saw X kill"" ""No u""

\- Visual Tasks: On - I prefer off. Just a boring way to get cleared...","among-us","0","","you said settings snobs welcome  here i am

•	⁠When discord is removed or the target dies, explode for the amplified damage discord did while active

•	⁠10 more ammo

•	⁠Volley is silent

•	⁠Headshots on discorded target slow them by 20% for 1 second

•	⁠Harmony orb surges with power when Zenyatta lands a killing blow, healing allies within 10m of the Harmony Orb target for 50hp.

"835","1. Unless you play with meme settings, there are only at most two impostors. If playing in a two impostor game with two engineers and it's 10+ people in the game, 50/50 is a perfectly acceptable bet. Don't vote it on 7 with two imps or 4 with one, but other than that, absolutely vote it. I'm sorry but I don't believe you are correct on hating this one.

2. These people are trolls. Ban them from your lobbies. 100% with you on that one.

3. That's the risk of pugging a lobby. Sometimes you just get a bad batch. Resetting and starting a new one has yielded the best results for me.

4. Silent play crew mate is half an impostor. Ban them from your lobby. Silent play impostor might be an attempt to stay unnoticed, especially if the lobby is of questionable quality. See if they are quiet when not impostor.

5. Random vote outs shouldn't be happening. Reset and make a new lobby if this occurs more than a couple times.

6. Inappropriate names, report and ban in that order. Don't start the game until this is done.

7. Bad chat = ban. Simple as that.

8. Start = ban unless the lobby is truly full and the host seems to be unaware (especially if they are actively talking).

"945","Instead of saying ACAB(all cops are bastar*ds) we should start saying ACAS(all cops are sus). Think about it, it's less offensive and it only shows that we think that a cop might be sus(suspicious) of something but not necesseraly guilty of it. It's the same thing in the popular game amogus with thinking that all red players are impostors really. This might sound stupid but hear me out. Statistically, every player regardless of their color has the same chance of being the impostor, yet, there is this social stigma that only red players are impostors. However, players of Amugus have developed this great system that will help them show their suspicion on someone without saying that they are the impostor(in case that they actually aren't). They say that someone is 'sus' so nobody gets their feelings hurt. We can apply this knowledge to the real world, right? If everyone can be an impostor in amongsus, regardless of their color, so can anyone be a bastard in real world, regardless of their task(job as some low inteligence individuals might call it).","among-us","1","0.0320452403393025","instead of saying acaball cops are bastards we should start saying acasall cops are sus think about it its less offensive and it only shows that we think that a cop might be sussuspicious of something but not necesseraly guilty of it its the same thing in the popular game amogus with thinking that all red players are impostors really this might sound stupid but hear me out statistically every player regardless of their color has the same chance of being the impostor yet there is this social stigma that only red players are impostors however players of amugus have developed this great system that will help them show their suspicion on someone without saying that they are the impostorin case that they actually arent they say that someone is sus so nobody gets their feelings hurt we can apply this knowledge to the real world right if everyone can be an impostor in amongsus regardless of their color so can anyone be a bastard in real world regardless of their taskjob as some low inteligence individuals might call it"

"450","ChatGPT roasting Into the Emerald Dream:

Alright, here we go. Into the Emerald Dream — where every class suddenly becomes a Druid, and you can almost hear the devs saying, “Yeah, who needs class identity when we can just sprinkle a little bit of ‘dream magic’ on everything, right?” It’s like they looked at the class system and thought, “What if every class could just shapeshift into a Druid and have the exact same cards?” Bam, everyone’s a Druid now. That’s class design, baby!

And speaking of design, let’s talk about those new keywords. Imbue? Oh, great, now we get to “imbue” all our cards with something that sounds like a weak potion you’d find in a low-budget fantasy novel. “I’ve imbued my Hero Power with power!” Really? That’s it? Like, I don’t need a fancy term for ”I did a thing to make my cards better”. Just call it what it is: buff. But no, we have to pretend it’s all mystical, like you’re weaving together spells from ancient runes when, in reality, you’re just stacking stats like it’s your mom’s Tupperware collection.

Then we have Dark Gifts. Yeah, because nothing says “fresh and exciting gameplay” like giving us the ability to “embrace” the powers of the void or whatever, in exchange for... what, exactly? A couple more cards in hand? Oh, wow, I’m so blessed to get Dark Gifts. Are they wrapped in black lace and delivered by mysterious, spooky entities? Nah, they’re just more cards that don’t really do anything unless you’ve already built a combo deck to force it into action. Call me when my Dark Gifts come with an actual gift—like a free win, or maybe some dignity after playing this dream-induced mess.

Honestly, this whole expansion is like if someone locked you in a room full of dream journals from 2002 and told you to make a card set based on the first vague sentence you read. The entire thing is just one giant fever dream where nothing is quite what it seems, every class has the same cards, and we’re all just hoping to wake up from it before it gets any more ridiculous. But hey, at least we get to imbue our decks with a bunch of new nonsense, right?","hearthstone","0","","chatgpt roasting into the emerald dream

"604","This is very similar to fishing priest. There is only 1 new card here from emerald dream here though no? Idk whats the point of calling it a new expansion deck tbh.

Also id argue your version of this deck is not optimized imo. 

no need for the 4 mana lifesteal spell. U lose the game if u dont kill ur opponent by turn 7 anyways so u dont care about the life steal ever.. not to mention how expensive it is for how much damage it deals.  Id play lower mana cost anything else for even better tempo. Such as the 1 cost 2/4 that damages you when it takes damage from perils in paradise + its another 1 drop for turn 1 or another fishing target. And also the 3 drop that summons a copy of itself when u take damage should go hand in hand too. 


Some other extra cards to consider would be,

-the spell that silencess your own minnions and gives them a +1+2 

-2 mana minnion from hunter that replays your last 1 cost card.

I could Mercy pocket my gold rank friend and he is going to put way better performance and numbers on the field because having a constant source of healing and damage boost just gives you an insane advantage.

Me and my friends have banned Mercy from our choice of heroes for the exact reason that whenever we did try to pocket one of us the matches just became way too easy and boring.

And it's nothing to do with us somehow smurfing but with the fact that it's hard to lose duels against enemy DPS players when you have a Mercy pocket and they have nothing.

Yeah this could have been a smurf but I always give a benefit of the doubt when it comes down to Mercy pocketing because nearly everyone would put really good stats on the field with one.","overwatch","0","","not necessarily because mercy pocketing is just a huge difference

"787","What the first guy said, wait till the new expansion, dust, craft a strong cheap deck when the meta settles.

If you want to climb right now, however, I would recommend what I've personally have had a lot of success with: weapon or archon rogue and elemental mage. I've climbed using a lot of other decks but the ones I mentioned are all really cheap, fast paced, and easy to pilot.

Weapon rogue you legit just mulligan for quick pick, draw a pirate, or your weaponsmith and go face, archon plays a bit more like a combo/big minion rogue where you play for board control and then play opportunistically with your archon and charge cards, and elemental mage plays like a standard midrange typa deck where you curve out and have a ton of different wincons.

"25","I have watched JKL on the international stage for years, and I've come to the conclusion that he is not serious about League at all. He is conducting some kind of social experiment. After being forcibly carried to a Worlds victory by TheShy in 2018, he must have started questioning the necessity of an ADC. Since then, his life's purpose seems to be testing the limits of how much an ADC can int while still allowing the team to secure victory. He is an ADC, but he's a ChillGuy who doesn't care at all about his trivial deaths. It's as if he believes that as long as the enemy team expends a lot of resources to kill him, his teammates should automatically win the team fight—assuming they are good enough. His insistence on playing Varus and Miss Fortune is also related to this philosophy","league-of-legends","0","","i have watched jkl on the international stage for years and ive come to the conclusion that he is not serious about league at all he is conducting some kind of social experiment after being forcibly carried to a worlds victory by theshy in  he must have started questioning the necessity of an adc since then his lifes purpose seems to be testing the limits of how much an adc can int while still allowing the team to secure victory he is an adc but hes a chillguy who doesnt care at all about his trivial deaths its as if he believes that as long as the enemy team expends a lot of resources to kill him his teammates should automatically win the team fight—assuming they are good enough his insistence on playing varus and miss fortune is also related to this philosophy"

"451","My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you’re watching this tape, I’m probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn’t want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn’t know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a “hit” on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I’m a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can’t take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.","hearthstone","0","","my name is walter hartwell white i live at  negra arroyo lane albuquerque new mexico  this is my confession if you’re watching this tape i’m probably dead murdered by my brotherinlaw hank schrader hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist shortly after my th birthday hank came to me with a rather shocking proposition he asked that i use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world connections that he made through his career with the dea i was astounded i i always thought that hank was a very moral man and i was thrown confused but i was also particularly vulnerable at the time something he knew and took advantage of i was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family hank took me on a ride along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make and i was weak i didn’t want my family to go into financial ruin so i agreed every day i think back at that moment with regret i quickly realized that i was in way over my head and hank had a partner a man named gustavo fring a businessman hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man and when i tried to quit fring threatened my family i didn’t know where to turn eventually hank and fring had a falling out from what i can gather hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business to which fring flatly refused to give him and things escalated fring was able to arrange uh i guess i guess you call it a “hit” on my brotherinlaw and failed but hank was seriously injured and i wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over  upon recovery hank was bent on revenge working with a man named hector salamanca he plotted to kill fring and did so in fact the bomb that he used was built by me and he gave me no option in it i have often contemplated suicide but i’m a coward i wanted to go to the police but i was frightened hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the albuquerque dea and about that time to keep me in line he took my children from me for  months he kept them my wife who up until that point had no idea of my criminal activities was horrified to learn what i had done why hank had taken our children we were scared i was in hell i hated myself for what i had brought upon my family recently i tried once again to quit to end this nightmare and in response he gave me this i can’t take this anymore i live in fear every day that hank will kill me or worse hurt my family i all i could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is"
"598","If you do not yet own the mini-set, it would be best to spend your gold on getting it. But if you do already own the miniset and are thinking about getting the zerg set just for the dust, it depends:

If you want to be efficient with your gold, you'll want to make sure you have enough gold to get all the rares for the new expansion. Worst-case scenario that will take 38 packs, but probably fewer than that. (It is more gold-efficient to open these cards from packs than to craft them using dust.)

If you have all the commons/rares for the new expansion, then it depends on if you want to keep opening new expansion packs for a chance at the new epic/legendary cards you want, or if you really just want the dust to craft what you want. On average a pack gives you 100 dust for 100 gold. With the nerf refunds, the zerg set will get you close to 200 dust per 100 gold spent. From a pure dust perspective, the zerg set is twice as good.","hearthstone","0","","if you do not yet own the miniset it would be best to spend your gold on getting it but if you do already own the miniset and are thinking about getting the zerg set just for the dust it depends

Also support staff and team clearly are not capable as seen during the season and the one game he was missing from. Spawn listing it as an achievement is wild. They were saved by his direct influence in person. 

This wouldn't happen in NBA and it shouldn't happen in LoL. Coaches have a direct influence negative or positive.

He said, “Why, so you can snipe me at 8 wins?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I thought he was going for a brofist, so I extended my hand only to have it slapped away in disgust. Later on I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen murlocs in his hands without paying.","hearthstone","1","0.0404040404040404","i saw kripp at the tavern yesterday i told him it would be cool to see him play arena again he said “why so you can snipe me at  wins” i was taken aback and all i could say was “huh” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh huh huh” and closing his hand shut in front of my face i thought he was going for a brofist so i extended my hand only to have it slapped away in disgust later on i saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen murlocs in his hands without paying"

A: the widowmaker skin chosen is not her default look
B: ana and pharah are related so it makes sense pharah resembles a young ana
C:mercy, brig, and Freya all hail from the upper parts of Europe in very close areas, so it's likely they would look similar
D:sym and sombra still look distinct besides the base features being considered the same
E: this list excludes and ignores a bunch of characters who DO have different faces, which shows it's not as big a problem (i.e mei, zarya, orisa, echo, junkerqueen, juno, illari, moira, sojourn, and depending on they're birth sex possibly venture)","overwatch","0","","ok so i do wanna make a argument that while yes alot of these characters do look similar on the basis of they have a conventional beauty design this is ignoring a few characters and ignoring a few facts

"375","They should just take the experience and be happy with that they managed to win the split

Results here don't matter that much for any team. Winter is the most irrelevant split there is, and all of a sudden we have a 5-team tournament starting right after their split ended, but with an entirely new meta (rip lane swaps) 

It's a bit fun for the viewers to have some international matchups, but overall it feels completely off and HLE playing for-fun champs while stomping doesn't help

Feels like we're watching showmatches instead of a tournament. There is no tournament feeling to this at all

Add more teams next year or this will always feel a bit irrelevant","league-of-legends","0","","they should just take the experience and be happy with that they managed to win the split

"476","Terrible designed quest but not the first time its tied to a specific mode. They did it probably to boost some internal metric. Whoever is in charge of event quests is just doing a terrible job and doesnt even try to improve.

Instead of designing quests as an incentive to play the game, wether its standard, wild, twist, arena, BGs, casual, friendly matches - they rather choose to narrow it to a specific mode for some unknown reasons.

The change to weekly quests (from 5 ranked wins, up to 15, then down to 10, then to ""10 games played"" - and then fully reverting the system to its original state and not even keeping a good change like ""play"" instead of ""win"") with +200% requirements for +20% rewards, already showed that either some people are out of touch or they simply dont care a whole lot about players sentiment.","hearthstone","0","","terrible designed quest but not the first time its tied to a specific mode they did it probably to boost some internal metric whoever is in charge of event quests is just doing a terrible job and doesnt even try to improve
